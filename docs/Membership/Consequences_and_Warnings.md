## Consequences

### Warnings

It is better to let someone know that their behaviour is liable to break the Citizen Hacman  [Membership Agreement](https://hacman.org.uk/rules)  prior to it actually doing so than issue them with a warning.

Any member can issue a warning to a person whose behaviour has broken the code of conduct. Complaints against other members should be reported via the [Complaints Form](https://forms.gle/HC2xJrz1XcXx4W1w7) as soon as practical. This can only be seen by the board of directors.

The form asks for the following compulsory information:

-   Reporter Name
-   Reporter Email
-   Identifying information (name/nickname/description) of the person
-   The time, date and location of the incident
-   Description of the incident
-   The frequency of incidents of this type
-   Other people involved in the incident/witnesses

### Asking people to leave

**Non-members**

Any non-member who breaks the Code of Conduct can be asked to leave by any member, this includes non-members who are guests of members.

**Members**

If a board member is present they get to make a decision about whether one (or all) of the member(s) have to leave the space. If no board member is present any two or more members who have witnessed the incident(s) may ask the member (or members) to leave the space.

Do not put yourself in danger: if the situation requires it call the police.

Criminal behaviour will not be tolerated.

### Restriction of access and termination of membership

Membership of the Hackspace may be restricted or terminated by the board for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines as to behaviour likely to cause restriction or termination of membership:

-   receiving three or more warnings from different sources within 6 months
-   continuing with behaviour after you have been asked to stop
-   a pattern of harassing behaviour, whether or not warnings have been issued
-   a single serious or obviously intentional offence such as taking compromising photographs (e.g. up their skirt), punching or groping someone

In the event of a serious accusation, the board reserves the right to suspend the accused's access to the Hackspace while investigations are carried out.

### Reporting inappropriate behaviour to the board

Any member can take a report from someone who has received harassment and passes that information to the board.

When taking a report from someone who has received harassment you should record faithfully what they say and reassure them that they are being taken seriously, however, you should avoid making specific promises regarding the actions of the board.

Ask for information the reporter has not volunteered (such as time and place of incident(s)) but do not pressure them into giving details if they do not feel comfortable doing so. Even if the report lacks key details (such as the identity of the person engaging in the harassing behaviour) it should still be recorded and passed to the board. If the reporter desires it arrange for an escort by a trusted person, contact a friend or family member to come and support them and/or contact the local police. Do not pressure the reporter into taking any actions they do not wish to. Respect the reporters' privacy, do not discuss their report outside the reporting structure (don't break the code of conduct yourself).

The report should include (as far as practicable):

-   the identity of the perpetrator (name/nickname/description)
-   time and date of the incident
-   time and date the report was received (if different)
-   the identity of the victim
-   your identity
-   the behaviour - this can be couched in general terms if the report requires it
-   the circumstances surrounding the incident
-   other people involved in the incident
-   Any other information you think is pertinent

### Public statements

As general rule members of Hackspace Manchester should avoid making public statements about the behaviour of individual people in relation to the code of conduct.

The board will make as much detail about bans and current warnings as they feel appropriately available to all members.

### Summary

If you have been asked to stop behaving in a certain way, do so. It's fine to ask what it is you're doing that is upsetting the person if it is not clear, but you shouldn't ask why the person is upset by it, it's enough that they are.

If you have to take action to stop someone behaving in a way contrary to the Citizen Hacman  [Membership Agreement](https://hacman.org.uk/rules)  do so, if possible consult with other members and/or the board, however, if action is required take it and explain later.
