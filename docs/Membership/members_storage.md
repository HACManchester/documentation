# Members Storage

The space provides limited storage for **active** projects.

All stored items should be in either member storage or large project storage. Members may use one cube space, or half of a shelf in the storage area. A shelf should be claimed via the members portal, and can be returned after use by the same system. The contents of the shelf should be clearly labelled with your name, the date and contact details. Contents must not overhang, overweigh, or otherwise interfere with others’ storage. It is recommended that you store your items in a box. Shelves are labelled with a letter and/or number. This refers to the ID number in the members storage system

To claim a space, click on Members Storage on the left hand menu and simply find the corresponding number and click claim.

**If you are currently violating member storage rules by having more than one cube or 1/2 a shelf please ensure you rectify this as you might otherwise find your stuff is moved so members without spaces can claim a space**

## Members Storage Guidelines

The Hackspace reserves the right to remove, dispose, donate or repurpose anything not stored inline with these guidelines. Do not leave projects in workshop areas.

* If a project becomes inactive please remove it from the space.
* Any labelled oversized items left in member’s storage will be moved to large project storage.
* Unlabelled large items in either of the storage areas will be moved to the ‘free stuff’ area, and may just vanish without warning!
* Items in large project storage with an expired “Do Not Hack” label will be moved directly to the ‘free stuff’ area, and may just vanish without warning!

### Large Projects

* If you’re going to take up a lot of space with a project you must ask on the forum for general permission to store your items.
* Oversized items must be stored in the large project storage area, not in members storage.
* Oversized items need to be clearly labelled with a Do Not Hack sticker including your name / unique nickname, a method of contacting you and an estimated finish date. If you are going to overshoot this finish date, replace the Do Not Hack sticker with an updated estimate.

### Prohibited Storage Items

* Dangerous / Flammable Chemicals.
* Lithium batteries must be in a safe charging-bag. Lithium charging bags are cheap.
* Illegal items
* Radioactive Materials
* No live animals or perishable articles including food
* No genetically modified organisms
