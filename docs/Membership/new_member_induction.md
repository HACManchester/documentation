# New Member Induction 
All members must complete their induction on the membership system. It takes two minutes at the most.

This is a general, space-wide induction that covers a lot of the basics.

To do this:
- Log into the membership system
- In the sidebar, select [General Induction](https://members.hacman.org.uk/account/0/induction)
- Read through each section 
- Once done, check the boxes at the bottom to confirm you've understood 
- Click save

### Deadline
Given the number of new joiners, we may need to ensure that inductions are done before access is granted, so that everyone understands the ethos and rules.

There's no set deadline for this yet, but to make sure you don't end up locked out, it's a good idea to do this induction now.
