# Angle Grinder

![](Angle_Grinder.jpeg "Angle_Grinder.jpeg")

We have an angle grinder in the workshop. This is used for making cuts
in metals.

There is a packet of spare discs in the box with the grinder, as well as
the spanner for changing them. Remember that the discs wear with use -
if you're doing a lot of cutting (or cutting through something very
tough) and thus using a lot of discs, it would be polite to replace what
you use
