**We hold open evenings every Wednesday evening, where we host 3 tours at 6:30pm, 7:30pm, and 8:30pm.**

These are free to attend. Just turn up, give our doorbell a ring, and we'll show you around.

Each tour will last about 20 minutes, during which a couple of your fellow members will:

- Walk you through what tools, equipment, and facilities we have
- Talk through general safety practices, and how you can request training for any equipment that requires it
- Let you know how to get involved â€“ our community runs the space
- And answer any questions you might have

All members must attend a tour before gaining independent access to the Hackspace.

If you've already signed up as a member, or you choose to do so during the open evening, we'll set up your access fob for 24/7 access to the Hackspace.

## How to find us

We are in the ground floor of Wellington House in Ancoats, behind the sunset-skyline painted door. See the [Find Us](https://www.hacman.org.uk/find-us/) page on our website for our exact address and transport guidance.

Once you've found our front door, there's a green doorbell you can press to let us know you've arrived.
