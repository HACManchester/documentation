Hackspace Manchester runs a tuck shop style area for snacks including juice, crisps, chocolate and other snacks for when you need substance during your time at the space. This regularly needs restocking and can be done by any member using our booker card available in one of the lockers in the space alternatively you just need our membership number which is 707095612 and the company name Manchester Makers Ltd.

Maximum spend for a Snackspace Run is Â£300 and the receipt alongside bank details should be sent to the board via email (board@hacman.org.uk) for reimbursement
