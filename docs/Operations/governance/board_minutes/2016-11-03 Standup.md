@fluffybit

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:22]*
@thinkl33t: "Take a photo of the rotting fire door and send it to Maria" Fahad sent them to me, I then forgot to send them on.

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:23]*
Cool - its the back door not the one in the staircase yeah?

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:24]*
I've PMed them to you

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:25]*
Ah yeah they're the wrong photos - I spoke with fahad about it and he said he'd take more of the other door

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:26]*
Cool

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:26]*
(last night)

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:26]*
I'm glad you checked 'em

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:26]*
Lets assume Ben isn't available and continue with discussion

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:27]*
We need to know if he's staying/going/standing for re-election

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:30]*
OK then.  If nobody else says before tomorrow they are standing down then i will.

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:30]*
sorted

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:30]*
We don't need to know if people want to re-stand until the 19th

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:30]*
I am happy to call the election

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:31]*
I stood down last year (I think)

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:31]*
Everyone except Kat stood last year iirc

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:31]*
<nods>

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:32]*
OK.  So how are we going to do nominations - We've done 2 methods in the past:
- Anyone can choose to stand
- Anyone can be nominated by any other member, and must agree to stand

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:32]*
First I suggest

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:33]*
I wouldn't have stood if Kat hadn't nominated me.

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:33]*
(Yes, I'm Kat's fault)

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:33]*
[In reply to Tamarisk]
Fair point

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:33]*
I prefer the latter personally

*Kat Reeve, [03.11.16 20:33]*
[In reply to Tamarisk]
don't regret it one bit

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:34]*
:)

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:34]*
Kat, first or second option??

*Kat Reeve, [03.11.16 20:34]*
I think that 2nd is better

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:35]*
We'll go for the second option then.

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:35]*
Cool

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:35]*
Oh, i missed form my standup notes:

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:36]*
- Got insurance quote estimate of 330 - have emailed insurer to get actual quote

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:36]*
Oooh yeah, I got an insurance quote too. Cause it seemed a sensible thing to do

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:37]*
With the nomination option, board members can choose to re-stand without needing a nomination (as they've been nominated by being elected previously)

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:37]*
cool

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:37]*
OK, anything else to discuss?

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:38]*
nope

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:38]*
I'd like everyone to take some time to look over the 'Elf and Safety rules

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:38]*
over the next week maybe

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:38]*
https://hackpad.com/Safety-in-the-Workspace-md61aaC2ugz

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:38]*
OK, shoot a link to the board@ email address so we have it somewhere obvious

*Tamarisk, [03.11.16 20:38]*
@BinaryKitten can you make sure you've documented the stuff you do please?

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:38]*
Or that

*Kat Reeve, [03.11.16 20:39]*
yup

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:39]*
Will also send it to board@

*Chris Hilliard, [03.11.16 20:40]*
Done

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:41]*

*Bob Clough, [03.11.16 20:41]*
