## Discussion
Hackspace could do with some **dusting.** Maybe needs a bit more colour, looks sad.<br>
Check in when JC is back around if we need **another board member.**<br>
**Expenses are generally stable,** went up a lot over the start of year but back down now, especially with electricity costs. Purchase proposals are the biggest variability at the moment but nothing big is planned.<br>
**Electric certs** are proving to be more work. We have a list of items we need done to get certified. Ben talked to Adam in person and is trying to get in contact to arrange a final certificate check.<br>
**Doorbot has been rewired** following incident. We probably want 
**Eye wash station** needs someone else to plumb it in.<br>
**Resin in the sink** is probably not going to happen and we will need to decomm it completely if nothing is happening with it.<br>
**New storage slots** have become available, Iâ€™ve put some notices on ones that are being used but not claimed. We need a discussion on storage in general.<br>
It seems the **CNC ammiel** is making will be loaned to the space but it needs a 16A run to the CNC room, weâ€™ve agreed it should happen as the area coordinator is also in favour of the CNC machine.<br>
**Social media** is a bit ded, thereâ€™s no process and people are just posting randomly.<br>
Kids easter event is probably ded now.<br>
We probably want to do another **blue cross event** and advertise it well.<br>
**EMF was a great success,** we want to use the marquee again. Logistics was a nightmare and we probably want a van for next time. Starting to look at workshops and extras for next times village.<br>
Maybe look at what mosi **events are coming up** or mini maker faires.<br>
**Zigbee network** is up and maybe used for continuous air and sound monitoring.<br>
**Prusa XL** has been sent back and will be looked at for repair. Quotes to follow.<br>
The **enders** should be gotten rid of as we donâ€™t have enough space at the moment for more 3d printers and they are inferior.<br>
We will want to stick to our **unattended rule** with 3d printing until insurers are changed, or our current ones agree to self insurance.<br>
**Parkspace** still needs more work.<br>
**Network cable** is now attached to the wall.<br>
Sorted massive box of stuff in the **corner of doom.** Some bits are being kept, we still have a lot of woodworking and other things that need clearing out.<br>
There is building work underway to **fix the leak** in electronics JC is all over it. <br>
We probably want to share **costco and bookers access** to all board members.<br>
**Website** is being cleaned up. Itâ€™s almost halfway to being fully upgraded.<br>
Talk about the next **CCTV next steps** at members meeting, we probably want to propose what it will look like and have a vote.<br>
We want to consolidate **hackspace rules** and incorporate critical infrastructure.<br>
We got a lot of positive feedback on **HTSD** and how it was run this time around. We are planning another one for September.<br>
VA was tied up during **HTSD** and improved nicely.<br>
Not sure what the plan was after **large storage clear out.** It seems Peter is happy to carry on with some kind of plan ðŸ¤·We probably need some plan.<br>
**Physical space workshop** went well and weâ€™ve got a lot of ideas, we just need people to start to implement them.<br>
We should make certain **branding assets** available.<br>
We'll need to work out what to do with **car parking** going forward.<br>
Agreed we can try putting infra tasks in the space on a **physical board.**
**Emergency lights** need regular testing.<br>
Weâ€™ve brought forward **volunteering shortfalls** and **membership payment types** for when JC is back.<br>
We need to talk about a **member's behaviour** which has been reported before and has repeated again.<br>
