# Guests in the Hackspace

Members are welcome to bring in guests including children and animals.

## Children and Young Adults (Under 18)

Children and Young Adults are welcome to attend the space as guests of members. It's important to note however that the space is an adult environment and due to these members may not be watching their language or potentially discussing adult topics. There may also be dangerous tools and chemicals around which may be in reach of children.

## Animals

Animals are allowed in the space but should be kept on leads at all times. It is wise to alert people if you are bringing in an animal in case of any allergies etc. The easiest way to do this is via telegram.

## Guests

Outside of the Open Evenings guests are welcomed into the space when accompanied by a member. Guests are not permitted to use tools that require inductions and must be supervised by the member at all times.
