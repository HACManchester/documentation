## Telegram
[Telegram](https://telegram.org) is an instant messaging platform some of our members use to keep in touch and help each other out. It's useful if you can't find something in the space and want a fast response.

Using telegram is optional. Announcements and important messages will always be posted to our forum first and foremost. **Please do not feel like you need to catch up on every message.**

### Installing Telegram
Telegram has a number of clients for various platforms:

- [Web client](https://telegram.org/dl/webogram) 
- [Desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS)](https://desktop.telegram.org/)
- [Android](https://telegram.org/dl/android)
- [iOS](https://telegram.org/dl/ios)
- [Windows Phone](https://telegram.org/dl/wp)

You will need a phone number to sign up for Telegram. This is kept private and hidden from other Telegram users by default, although other Telegram users who already have your phone number in their address book will be notified that you have joined Telegram.

### Notifications

Lots of conversations happen on telegram. To avoid being overloaded by notifications, you may can either mute individual channels which do not interest you etc or mute the entire group.

If you mute any channels, you may still receive notifications from them if another person directly mentions you or replies to one of your messages.
