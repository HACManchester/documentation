We have a number of group chats in [Telegram](https://telegram.org) that we encourage members to use to keep in touch, help each other out, and stay up to date with news and announcements.

Some of these group chats are used to coordinate training for certain pieces of equipment.

Telegram has a number of clients for various platforms:

- [Web client](https://telegram.org/dl/webogram) 
- [Desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS)](https://desktop.telegram.org/)
- [Android](https://telegram.org/dl/android)
- [iOS](https://telegram.org/dl/ios)
- [Windows Phone](https://telegram.org/dl/wp)


You will need a phone number to sign up for Telegram. This is kept private and hidden from other Telegram users by default, although other Telegram users who already have your phone number in their address book will be notified that you have joined Telegram.

## Notifications

Our group chats can be busy places. To avoid being overloaded by notifications, you may want to mute some or all of our groups.

If you mute any groups, you may still receive notifications from them if another person directly mentions you or replies to one of your messages.

## Groups

The following tables list our group chats and their purpose. Click the group's name to join.

> To prevent abuse, Telegram limits the amount of groups you can join within 24 hours.
