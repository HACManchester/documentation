Hacman Group Chat
-----------------

Hacman has [a Telegram group](https://t.me/HACManchester) which you are
welcome to join!

This contains many Hackspace members, as well as interested or
interesting people. It's a good place to ask questions for a quick
answer, ask for advice, or share news and links of interest to fellow
hackers. There are [web](https://telegram.org/dl/webogram) clients for
Telegram, as well as official clients for [Windows, Linux, OS
X](https://desktop.telegram.org/),
[Android](https://telegram.org/dl/android),
[iOS](https://telegram.org/dl/ios), and [Windows
Phone](https://telegram.org/dl/wp). You will need a phone number (not
necessarily a UK one) to sign up for Telegram.

Please familiarise yourself with our [Citizen Hacman
Commitment](https://list.hacman.org.uk/t/citizen-hacman-a-revised-membership-agreement-and-hackspace-rules-final/2609)
before chatting.

#### Notifications

This is a relatively high traffic channel (replacing IRC, which is no
longer active). It's recommended that if using a phone app you disable
notifications for the group (you will still receive notifications if
someone sends you a PM, or if someone addresses or mentions you
specifically).

### Group Channels

**Note we were using <http://protect-mylinks.com/addlinks> to avoid spam bots adding
themselves to the channels, but it looks like they've started using annoying adds so that's been turned off**

Several groups that look after parts of the hackspace have specific
channels on telegram so they don't clog up the main channel.
