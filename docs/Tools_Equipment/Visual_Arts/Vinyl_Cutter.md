# Vinyl Cutter

This cutter is a PCUT CT630. Bob Bought it off eBay for Â£10, spares /
repair.

Seems to work-ish in manual mode, but cant get it going at all in HPGL
mode.

Broken Shit:

-   Top Right of the carriage is cracked
-   Right hand endstop is missing (not 100% needed - endstops just reset
    the machine)
-   Wont talk to me on USB serial - Need to try hardware serial port.
