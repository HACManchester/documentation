# Sewing Machines

Currently, we have a Lervia 564 sewing machine, and a Singer 4423 Heavy
Duty machine arriving soon. Users that are not competent at using a
machine are required to take an induction, as much for the machine's
safety, and that of your fabric, as your own.

## Lervia 564 sewing machine

A LIDL-bought sewing machine, fairly basic, and usable - a good starting
machine.

## Singer 4423 Heavy Duty

This machine is a heavy-duty machine, and is more of an 'advanced' user
machine. Some reviews quote it as going through upto eight layers of
denim without a problem, and the machine is even able to cope with thin
leather.
