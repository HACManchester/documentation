# Who to Contact

The Hackspace is entirely member run, so for most things you'll want to speak to regular members. For some issues you may want to speak to the board, who are elected members. They only deal with the critical and business stuff. For everything else, the community is who to ask.

### Telegram group chats, or the Forum
The [Forum](https://list.hacman.org.uk) is a good place to post things, we have different categories for the different areas of the space.
You can also use [Telegram](https://docs.hacman.org.uk/Telegram/) for things requiring a fast answer, or to be added to different group chats.

-   Issue with Equipment / maintenance required
    
-   Training / Induction on equipment requests
