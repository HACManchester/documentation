# Belt Sander

![](beltsander.jpeg "beltsander.jpeg")

We have a belt sander in the workshop. This is used for smoothing
material and removing excess material. It uses a standard belt that
comes in different grades and these belts wear out with use. This is
usable by anyone who has had a workshop safety induction.

## Safety

  - Wear eye protection - hot debris in the eye is not pleasant
  - If using this equipment for a significant amount of time, a dust
    mask is adviseable.
  - Do **NOT** wear gloves - they could get entangled and pull your hand
    into the machine
