### **Features**
The Mitre Saw is typically used to chop wood, however the blade can be changed to allow for other materials.  This saw uses a 255mm diameter blade and has a maximum cross cut of 300 x 60mm due to slide carriage. The Saw has a maximum vertical axis angle of 45&deg; and a maximum horizontal axis angle of 45&deg; allowing for compound angles.

The Mitre Saw is mounted on the main workbench with the height set to allow for the surrounding bench to be utilised for support.  Built into the work bench is T-slot track that allows members to attach various accessories & stop blocks to the benches.  Members are required to ensure that when cutting, the material is firmly clamped in place.

Cutting Blade:
- Diameter = 255mm
- Bore = 24.5mm
- Kerf = 1.7mm

As standard the space stocks a replacement blade for the machine.  Damaged and broken blades should be reported to the Woodwork Team so that replacements can be acquired.  Members requiring
specialised blades can source them themselves.
