Our Bambu P1S has the following details:

Name: **Delilah**
IP: 172.16.0.201
Access code: 24877583

Please note the access code may change from time to time if people in the space make a mistake on the printer. Please see the 'how to find the code' section for how to find the access code from the printer.

- The maximum print area is 233 x 248 x 250 [depending on print orientation.] 

- The printer is equipped with an AMS for multi colour and multi material prints. You can use the following materials in the AMS. PLA, PETG, ASA, PC, PA, PVA. You may use all space supplied materials except for TPU in the AMS.Please do not fill the AMS with abrasive filaments. Always remove your own filament from the AMS after use. If you do not remove your filament, it can and will be used by other members.

- Please use the Prusa printers ([Prusa MK4](./prusa_mk4.md), [Prusa XL](./prusa_xl4.md)) for TPU.

- Please do not attempt any sort of maintenance on the printer, other than the troubleshooting guides in this document: If it doesn't work, ask the team in person or on telegram.

- You can monitor the printer from the camera. However this can only be done from computers within the Hackspace, or connected to the Hackspace's Wi-Fi.

The best way to interface with the printer is by installing [Bambu Studio](https://bambulab.com/en/download/studio) or [OrcaSlicer](https://www.orcaslicer.com/). Once this is done, load up the camera by pressing play to ensure your connection is correct. Once you have connected the printer, you can sync the nozzle and bed information. You can also sync the filament information automatically if using bambu branded filament. 

**How to connect to the printer with Bambu Studio:**

1. Connect to the hackspace wifi
2. Open Bambu studio and navigate to the 'device' page on top
3. Select 'bind with access code' 
4. Enter the IP and access code. You should be connected.

**How to load filament into the AMS:**

1. Open the AMS cover
2. Put your roll in a slot, and find the end
3. Gently push the grey tab in front of the feeder, and push the filament for about 2 cm. The AMS will detect the filament and will start the loading procedure.
4. Your filament is now loaded. You do NOT need to press load on the printer

**How to load filament without the AMS: (for abrasive filaments only)**

1. Disconnect the PTFE tubing from the quick connector on the back of the printer
2. Mount your roll on the back of the printer (you may need to temporarily remove the poop chute)
3. Insert the filament into the back of the quick connector until it reaches the extruder.
4. Select load on the printer, and once the nozzle reaches 250C gently push the filament through until you see it extrude
5. Once your print is finished, select unload to unload your filament.

**How to resolve the AMS motor getting stuck and your filament not correctly rewinding:**

1. push the filament roll gently towards the front of the AMS, and then back again, the yellow gear should disengage from the black gear on the roller.

**How to find the access code:**

1. Go to the printer and select the 3rd option on the menu. 
2. Navigate to where it says WLAN: Hackspace and hit enter
3. Observe the access code

**Please never change the access code, turn off LAN mode, or attempt to login to the printer. You will mess up access for everybody else and require a maintainers time to resolve. If you continually do this, we will ask you to simply use the Prusas.**
