## Feeds and Speeds Chart

**Please Note that feeds and speeds are highly dependent on many variables, and this is just a 'starter' list. They operate heavily in conjunction with stepdown and strategy. A starter stepdown will be included in the list. The following will affect feeds and speeds.

 - Tool Quality/Type
 - Tool size
 - Desired result of operation (roughing, finish, etc)
 - Stepdown and stepover
 - Operation toolpath (trochoidal, slotting etc)
 - Size of stock
 - Number of teeth
 - Number of Flutes
 
 You generally want to always select the following in all materials:
 - Climb milling
 - One way
 - Tabs on the cut through op
 - Disabled coolant

**Cutting Table:**

| Material  | Speed (rpm)  | Speed (mm/min   | Tool  | Stepdown  |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Woood  | 14000-17000   | 4000-6000  | All   | 10mm  |
| Wood Planing/Surfacing | 14000-160000 | 2500-4500 | 45mm  | 0.1-1mm  |
| Aluminium  | 22000-240000  | 3000-6000  | 2mm-10mm  | 2mm  |
| Aluminium Planing/Surfacing | 24000 | 3000-4500 | 25mm  | 0.1-1mm  |
| Brass  | 20000-240000  | 2000-4000  | 2mm-10mm  | 2mm   |
| Steel  | 7000-14000   | 400-6000 | 4mm-8mm  | 0.2-1mm   | 

Note that cutting steel indroduces extra risks and requires skill and experience. You will need to do an addon induction to cut steels. You can also cut acrylic, and thick leather, as well as copper and cast iron (if you want to look like a miner.) Please seek guidance before doing this.
