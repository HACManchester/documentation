This file is intended for those with some experience in CNC machining, who are looking to use this machine. The information contained herein will be expanded upon during induction and learning, but is designed as a quick guide and reference.

- The machine home is the back right. When you home the machine, this also zero's the DRO. Soft limits are set to prevent crashes, as well as hard limits which are based on the inductive switches, usually used for homing. The Y2 limit switch does not interact with the machine in any way except during homing. It is used to autosquare should the previous user have knocked alignment. 
- G59.3 is at X0Y498. This is the toolsetter location and is persistent. You are free to use G54-G59 for any WCS you desire. Tool length is variable, and toolsetting using M6 always retracts fully before setting to give maximum flexibility. You can reference TLS/TLO with the 3D probe connected, and running M6T99 and then cycle start. This will set your reference, ready for M6 in gcode. This will be covered in induction. Once you have set TLO you are free to use the probe to set your WCS.
- Recommended feed in Aluminium and wood is between 3500 and 6000 mm/min, with the sweet spot around 4500. Workholding needs must be respected if using any sort of serious stepdown. This will be covered in induction
- Recommended spindle speeds are 15000-19000 for wood, 21000-24000 for aluminium, and 10000-12000 for steel.
- The left side of the bed X600-X300 is almost entirely straight over Z. The right side has around 0.1mm of twist in the gantry over around 120mm of Z travel. If you don't know what this means, it's not relevant, but if doing a precision bit with a lot of  thickness, use the left side of the bed. 
- IOSender is fully setup and ready to go on the HP mini pc. You can import your cnc files or login to fusion to do your camming before you start. Use M6 in your Gcode to take advantage of semi automatic toolchanging. When you run your program, and when a toolchange is needed, you will see TOOL in the sender. Change the tool, and hit cycle start. WCS updating will be automagical
- Threadmilling is perfectly possible 
- Currently we are using the Camvac for woods, and the Yellow vac for metals. Use the collet fan in aluminium and as desired, though not with wood. Use the dust shoe as required. 
- The compressor is not up to the task of cnc work. We are working on solutions, but for now, just use air when required, and the collet fan otherwise. 
-  Workholding equipment, Precision calipers and other indicators are available under the bed in the bottom half of the enclosure. 
- The left side of the enclosure easily slides off if required. Please replace before machining
