  **This project will use the following organism(s):**

  ▢ \| **All the organisms being used in this project are not classified
  as a hazard group 2, 3 or 4 \| organism according to the \| \`Approved
  List of Biological Agents
  \<http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc208.pdf>\`\_\_ \[#\]\_**

  ▢ \| **All of these organisms are unlikely to cause human disease.**

  **Further details:**

  ▢ \| **All of these organisms are not a hazard to employees/workers
  within the organisation.**

  **Further details:**

  ▢ \| **All of these organisms are not transmissible to the community.**

  **Further details:**

  ▢ \| **Effective treatment and/or prophylaxis (including vaccines) is
  available for all of these \| organisms.**

  **Further details:**

  **Outline of the modifications to be made to the organism in this
  project:**

  ▢ \|**The modifications to be made to the organism are unlikely to
  increase its pathogenicity.**

  **Further details:**

  ▢ \| **The modifications to be made to the organisms are unlikely to
  increase any hazard posed to \| the environment given the containment
  procedures stated below.**

  **Further details:**

  ▢ \| **Any work done with genetically modified organisms (GMOs) will
  adhere to containment level 1 \| (CL1) containment procedures according
  to LBL05001, including the standard procedure for \| deactivation of
  GMO contaminated waste through autoclaving as detailed in LBL04006.**

  **Details of any non-standard GMO disposal procedure:**

  ▢ \| **The organisms used in this project will be stored in BioLab in
  the refrigerator, freezer or \| in an appropriate place at room
  temperature. The door to the lab will be locked to prevent \|
  unauthorised access to the BioLab during storage.**

  **Details of any non-standard storage of organisms:**

  ▢ \| **Any standard procedures carried out in the lab will follow the
  Manchester Hackspace BioLab Standard \| Operating Procedures.**

  **Details of any non-standard procedures:**

  ▢ \| **The modified organisms will not leave the Manchester Hackspace BioLab
  BioLab during this project in \| order to minimise the risk of
  introduction to the wider environment.**

  ▢ \| **In the event of an accident, the health and safety of persons
  outside the BioLab are \| unlikely to be seriously affected. A prepared
  emergency plan is therefore not necessary.**
