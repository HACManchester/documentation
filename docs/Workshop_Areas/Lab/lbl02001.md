## Purpose

This describes the laboratory induction procedure to be carried out by
the BSO for all individuals wishing to use the laboratory facility. It
is a requirement that individuals complete this induction procedure and
confirm their adherence to the requirements mentioned in this induction
by signing the appropriate training sheet.

## Scope

This applies to the BSO for the purposes of training and registering
individuals as authorised lab users.

## Responsibilities

The BSO is responsible for making sure the induction is itself carried
out safely and to ensure that by the end of induction the inductees
understand:

-   That use of, and access to, the laboratory is subject to agreeing to
    follow the [Manchester Hackspace BioLab BioLab Rules](biolab-rules.md) and
    by extension agreeing to follow the [Manchester Hackspace BioLab BioLab Usage Guidelines](biolab-usage-guidelines.md) and SOPs.
-   That failing to follow the BioLab Rules or acting in a way that
    endangers others or the environment is grounds for being barred from
    accessing the laboratory.
-   How to access the lab and who is allowed in the lab.
-   That work with organisms in risk groups 2 and above is strictly
    forbidden in the lab and how to identify the risk group of an
    organism.
-   The requirements for beginning work on a project, especially when
    working with GMOs.
-   How to safely work with micro-organisms to minimise contamination
    risks.
-   How to safely handle chemicals and reagents and where to seek
    further information.
-   How to effectively use the PPE provided in the lab.
-   How to handle incidents of spillage, equipment malfunction or
    injury.
-   How to safely operate the equipment in the lab and where to seek
    further information about its operation.
-   That in case of any uncertainty about a procedure the BSO should be
    sought for further information.

## Definitions

BSO:   Biological Safety Officer

GM:   Genetically Modified

GMO:   Genetically Modified Organism

GMP:   Good Microbiological Practice

MSDS:   Material Safety Data Sheet

PPE:   Personal Protective Equipment

## Procedures

### General Safety Briefing

The inductees will all be provided with an information handout
consisting of the [BioLab Rules](biolab-rules.md), [BioLab Usage Guidelines](biolab-usage-guidelines.md), and the [DIYBio EU Code of Ethics](http://diybio.org/codes/draft-diybio-code-of-ethics-from-european-congress/)[^1].
These documents cover all the points covered during the induction and
gives details of where to find more information about lab procedures.

The inductees will be informed about the need to be mindful of the
potential risks and hazards present within a biological laboratory
working to containment level one standards.

The inductees will be informed of the requirements that must be
fulfilled before work on a project can commence. This includes:

-   Familiarising themselves with the material safety data sheet (MSDS)
    of any reagent to be used in the project.
-   Being aware of all the SOPs that address the kind of procedures to
    be carried out in the project.
-   The need to be aware of the safety requirements and skill level
    necessary when working with reagents and equipment needed in the
    project.
-   The need to carry out a written risk assessment for projects
    involving GMOs.

### Chemicals and Storage

The inductees will be informed of need to follow storage requirements
for reagents. The inductees will be informed of the need to familiarise
themselves with the MSDS of any reagent before working with that reagent
and where to find MSDSs.

### Use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

The inductees will be shown the location and the correct use of the PPE
provided in the lab. The inductees will be informed that the BSO is to
be contacted, before any practical work is commenced if suitable PPE is
not available.

The PPE necessary for work with Ethidium Bromide (EtBr) or any other
work inside the EtBr contaminated area will be emphasised.

### Working with Micro-organisms

It will be stressed to the inductees that work in the Manchester
Biohackspace BioLab is limited to organisms in hazard group 1
(biological agents unlikely to cause human disease). An explanation of
how to identify the hazard group classification of an organism using
official databases will be given.

The inductees will be informed of where further details and resources
can be found, and it will be stressed that in the case of uncertainty
the BSO should be consulted.

The importance of GMP during all work with micro-organisms will be
explained to the inductees: that GMP is essential in order to prevent
contamination of the laboratory by the organisms being handled and
prevent contamination of the work with organisms from the environment.

A demonstration of the basic techniques for GMP will be given.

The procedure for dealing with spillages of micro-organisms will be
given and the location of the spill kit will be pointed out.

### Special GMO considerations

An explanation will be given of what is considered to be a GMO and what
sort of projects are classed as containment level 1 (CL1) projects.

The additional measures and procedures necessary for working with GMOs
will be explained.

These include:

-   The need to carry out a written risk assessment before work
    commences with the GMO(s).
-   That GMOs may not be taken outside the laboratory unless a risk
    assessment has been approved to do so.
-   The need to deactivate all containment level 1 biomaterial in the
    autoclave before disposal.

The inductees will be informed of where further details and resources
can be found, and it will be stressed that in the case of uncertainty
the BSO should be consulted.

### Refrigerator, Freezer and Sample Storage

An explanation will be given of the need to exercise caution when
working with the refrigerator and freezer due to the presence of
biomaterial.

### Operation of Laboratory Equipment

Explanations and, where practical, short demonstrations of the SOPs for
the following equipment:

-   Microwave
-   ~~PCR Machine~~
-   ~~Electrophoresis Power Supply~~
-   ~~UV illuminator~~
-   HEPA flow cabinet/area
-   Autoclave
-   Sink area
-   Incubator
-   ~~Centrifuges~~

### Documentation of Training

Each inductee that has successfully completed will sign the appropriate
section of the [BioLab Training ConfirmationSheet](biolab-training-confirmation-sheet) to confirm their adherence to the requirements explained during the induction.

The BSO will also sign the appropriate section of the document to
confirm the successful completion of the induction for each inductee.

### Laboratory Access Control

Once the above procedures have been completed the inductee and their
confirmation will be added to the list of authorised lab users by the
BSO. The inductees will be instructed on the operation of the number
lock and card sensor which provide access control for the laboratory.
