## Purpose

The purpose here is to highlight the role that a Biological Safety
Officer (BSO) plays in maintaining and implementing the rules and
guidelines laid out in the SOPs and associated documentation, including
the government regulations on the use, disposal and containment of
chemicals, biological organisms and waste.

The intention here is also describe where responsibility lies in terms
of ensuring that guidelines and regulations are followed in practice.
Particularly where responsibility passes from BSO to the Principal
Investigator (PI) or lab user when undertaking work within the
laboratory.

## Scope

All users of the Manchester Hackspace BioLab BioLab need to be aware of the
BSO\'s role and be able to locate and communicate with the BSO should
any queries regarding safe and correct lab usage arise.

## Responsibilities

It is the BSO\'s responsibility to carry out the BSO\'s role outlined in
this document. and the general BioLab.

## Related documents

All other SOPs documented here reflect the best practice approach to
using the Manchester Hackspace BioLab BioLab, if in any doubt please contact the
BSO for clarification.

## Definitions

BSO:   Biological Safety Officer

PI:   Principal Investigator

SOP:   Standard Operating Procedure

GMO:   Genetically Modified Organism

PPE:   Personal Protective Equipment

## Requirements

1.  The BSO exists to ensure that the Manchester Hackspace BioLab SOPs and
    therefore the required safety regulations are adhered to by users of
    the BioLab. The SOPs have been defined based on relevant regulations
    and advice sought from qualified third parties. The SOPs reflect
    correct and safe lab usage.
2.  It is the BSO\'s responsibility to induct new users into the
    laboratory (as per [LBL02001](lbl02001.md)) so that other Bio Lab
    users are aware of the risks and correct approach involved in all
    typical BioLab procedures or to ensure that qualified trainers
    perform the induction which is ultimately checked and signed off by
    the BSO.
3.  The BSO will maintain a list of inducted individuals and trainers.
4.  It is the BSO\'s responsibility to maintain the SOP documentation by
    validating any edits and additions to these procedures for the
    purposes of clarity and consistency.
5.  The BSO will ensure that there is a regular review of all
    established SOPs to ensure that they stay up to date. This can occur
    on an ad-hoc basis but not less than annually.
6.  The BSO must ensure that appropriate PPE is available as required
    and that any request for further information or assistance from
    BioLab usrs is reasonably met. However, once a BioLab user has been
    inducted (as per [LBL02001](lbl02001.md)), he/she becomes
    responsible for their own health and safety within the lab, and also
    that of other\'s who may also be working within the vicinity of
    his/her experiments/equipment.
7.  The BSO will seek confirmation that any work carried out involving
    the genetic modification of organisms within the lab conforms to
    [The Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations
    2014](http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2014/1663/contents/made)[^1].
    For anyone undertaking this kind of work, the SOPs covering correct
    handling and disposal of GMOs must be followed and the BSO will
    ensure that any projects involving GMOs will only commence if an
    adequate risk assessment has been completed and approved by the BSO
    and any external/third party GM advisors.
8.  The BSO will maintain a record of all risk assessments carried out
    for projects in the BioLab. This record will be kept for at least
    ten years.
9.  The BSO should make sure that supply of consumables such as spill
    kit and first aid kit contents are maintained.
10. Ultimately, the BSO must determine whether a lab user is using the
    laboratory facility in a correct and safe manner and intervene when
    further advice or assistance is required. It is the BSO\'s
    responsibility to restrict access to the laboratory facility for any
    potential lab user until that potential lab user can consistently
    demonstrate knowledge of correct and safe laboratory usage.
