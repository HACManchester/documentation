## Purpose

This SOP describes the make-up of the Safety Committee in terms of its
members, the roles which the safety committee plays in terms of the
operation of the Manchester Hackspace BioLab and the responsibilities of
the Safety Committee.

## Scope

All users of the Manchester Hackspace BioLab need to be aware of the
Safety Committee\'s roles, especially with regards to work with GMOs.
Appointed members of the Safety Committee must be aware of the roles and
responsibilities borne by the Safety Committee, as a whole, and thus the
roles and responsibilities each individual appointed member of the
Safety Committee bears. The directors of Manchester Biological Laboratories
Ltd. should also be aware of the roles and responsibilities of the
committee in order make informed decisions when appointing new members
of the Safety Committee.

## Responsibilities

The appointed members of the Safety Committee are required to ensure the
Safety Committee fulfils the roles described in the this SOP.

## Definitions

BSO:   Biological Safety Officer

PI:   Principal Investigator

SOP:   Standard Operating Procedure

GMO:   Genetically Modified Organism

PPE:   Personal Protective Equipment

## Requirements

### Composition of the Safety Committee

The Safety Committee comprises 3 permanent members:

-   the Biological Safety Officer (BSO),
-   and two directors of Manchester Makers Ltd.

In addition, the three permanent members of the Safety Committee may
appoint temporary members who possess expertise relevant to the decision
at hand.

### Roles of the Safety Committee

1.  The safety committee will make decisions and give advice relating to
    environmental and personal safety within the Manchester Hackspace BioLab
    BioLab. However, the BSO is primarily responsible for ensuring that
    lab users are capable and enabled to follow the rules and guidelines
    laid out in the SOPs and associated documentation (including
    relevant government legislation).
2.  The safety Committee must review contained use risk assessments
    carried out by PIs proposing projects involving GMOs. The committee
    must work with the PI to ensure the assessment is adequate.
3.  In the case where the permanent members of the safety committee
    believe their collective expertise is not sufficient to ensure a
    well informed review of a risk assessment, they will appoint at
    least one temporary member with sufficient expertise relevant to the
    subject of the risk assessment.
4.  The safety committee should advise the directors of Manchester
    Biological Laboratories Ltd. on whether to approve the commencement
    of work on a project where approval from the directors is required.
