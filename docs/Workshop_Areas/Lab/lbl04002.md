## Purpose

This describes the operation of the Hakins Pressure cooker with regard to
the preparation of microbial culture media.

## Scope

This should be observed every time the autoclave is used within the 
BioLab for media preparation.

## Responsibilities

The operator of the autoclave is responsible for their own safety and
that of others in the vicinity during its use. The particular risks
presented in using this piece of equipment are primarily due to the high
temperatures generated, steam and high pressures. There is also a risk
of the shattering of sealed glass containers if air is trapped.

The operator is responsible for ensuring complete sterilization of
containers, glassware, tubes, media and equipment. To ensure
environmental microbes do not contaminate the target microbe strain.

  Autoclave](lbl08002.md)

## Materials

The main consumables for the autoclave are RO water and autoclave tape.

DI water needs to be added before running the pressure cooker 

The autoclave tape should be used to seal items to be sterilized and is
stored on the shelf nearby. Order replacement from

or appropriate similar product.

## Procedures

### Sterilization of liquid media \<1L volumes

For sterilization of liquid media up to 1 litre, that requires 15
minutes @ 15 psi and 121 C, please use set heater according 
### Sterilization of liquid media \>1L volumes

For sterilization of liquid media of greater volumes than 1 litre, you
need to preheat the autoclave and place the material to be sterilized in
the autoclave 15 minutes before starting the programme. This is to
ensure that the bulk volume of liquid comes up to temperature in time
for the main sterilization phase.


Then run for 15 minutes @ 15 psi and 121 C Please set heater according
