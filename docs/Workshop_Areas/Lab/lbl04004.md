## Purpose

This describes the usage of the BioLab incubator.

## Scope

This relates only to the black bench top incubator.

## Responsibilities

This applies to anyone using this piece of equipment. The user should
avoid contaminating the work of others when operating the incubator.

## Related documents

Several other procedures require the use of the incubator, see SOP
contents for further details.

## Procedures

The incubator consists of a front door, a temperature indicator.


When opening the door of the incubator it is likely that the temperature
inside the chamber drops significantly (when set above room temperature)
so the user should be conscious of how this may effect other experiments
in progress within and minimise the amount of time left open.

The user should clean up any spillage which might occur when cultures
are taken from or placed in the incubator.
