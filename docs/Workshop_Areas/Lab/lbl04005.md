## Purpose

-   general description of the SOP purpose

## Scope

-   the extent of the SOP in terms of to what equipment and procedures
    it applies, also when and where (which will always be at all times
    in the Bio lab).

## Responsibilities

-   for who is the procedure relevant, typically the operator and anyone
    present while it's carried out, it's also worth mentioning the risks
    here and that the operator is responsible for their health and
    safety and that of anyone else present during the procedure.

## Materials

-   Are there any extra materials required, in the case of operating an
    instrument, peice of equipment or in a molecular biology procedure
    this might be consumables, reagents, chemicals or other
    instrumentation, e.g pipets. Any special PPE can be mentioned here.

## Related documents

-   Are other SOPs (or other documents within our framework) related to
    this procedure. If so then listing them here can be useful, for
    example the media prep SOP might be relevant when carrying out the
    transformation procedures and it saves time to link it here rather
    than describe the preparation of media in every procedure where it
    is used (bit like an include/import/use lol).

## Definitions


## Procedures


## Resources

-   This is where eternal useful documention can be linked, much like
    the references section in any academic paper.
