## Purpose

The purpose of this SOP is to highlight the requirements to lab users
starting new projects in the Manchester Hackspace BioLab BioLab in terms of the
risks presented by undertaking such work. In particular, risks from the
use of chemicals, reagents and equipment should be considered along with
the important considerations that are essentially for working with
genetically modified organisms.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all users of the Manchester Hackspace BioLab BioLab
proposing a CL1 project.

## Responsibilities

Ultimately, the laboratory user who initiates and undertakes the lab
work (i.e. the principal investigator) is responsible for the health and
safety considerations and containment requirements involved with their
project. It is a requirement that they be aware of the risks involved in
the project and the exposure to these risks by themselves, other lab
users, the wider community and the environment. Before commencing any
work the risks involved in the project must be assessed by the the
principal investigator, they must seek advice from an experienced third
party and the satisfactory results of this process must be signed off by
the Biological Safety Officer.

The Principal investigator should begin by making a copy of the template
risk asessment that is available here: - [GMO Activity Risk Assessment
Template](https://goo.gl/C91Jpu). It is important to fully consider each
of the section requirements before submitting the Risk assessment for
evaluation by the BSO/GMSC.

## Procedures

### Assessing the risks in projects involving GMOs

For a project involving GMOs, the PI must provide a written risk
assessment of the contained use to be undertaken.

#### Items for PIs to consider

1.  Consider the potential hazardous properties from your micro-organism
    cross referenced to national categorisation lists, e.g [Approved
    List of Biological
    Agents](http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/misc208.pdf)[^1].

2.  Any micro-organisms to be used within the lab must fall within the
    hazard group 1 (HG1) category. Biological agents are categorised
    into HG categories based on the following criteria:

    1.  are they harmful to human health?
    2.  are they a hazard to employees/workers within the organisation?
    3.  transmissible to the community?
    4.  whether effective treatment and/or prophylaxis (including
        vaccines) are available?

3.  The PI should consider how the micro-organism is being modified (in
    the case of GMMs), e.g are there enhancements of function, altered
    tropisms and/or altered routes of transmission? Consideration should
    be given to impacts on its hazardous properties i.e. more
    pathogenic, attenuated or unchanged.

4.  In handling the organism the PI should consider any risks involved,
    for example what PPE will be required? What risks are involved in
    setting up and running fermentation and growth systems, for example.
    Particularly, are any non-standard procedures involved?

5.  The PI should consider any special requirements in disposing of the
    micro-organisms, in particular, to ensure destruction of viable
    organisms, any GMO contaminated waste should be inactivated by
    autoclaving as detailed in [LBL04006](lbl04006.md).

6.  The PI should consider the storage requirements for the organism,
    such as whether the organism will be stored frozen, in the fridge
    and/or at room temperature and if it requires any other special
    storage requirements.

7.  Important: If the micro organism is in risk group 1 and will be
    genetically modified then containment level one procedures must be
    adhered to.

    **Note**: If it is deemed to be in hazard group 2 or higher then
    this organism cannot be used in the BioLab. The PI should understand
    the difference between the HG groups and be able to explain why the
    organism falls into HG1 and not higher.

8.  The principal investigator should also assess the risks to the
    environment involved with the organism. Particularly, genetically
    modified organisms developed in the lab should not be allowed to
    leave the defined containment area in case of the risk of becoming
    introduced to the wider environment where they may have an impact on
    either the ecosystem or health of the community.

    1.  Consider, for example, the capacity of a GM plant to survive and
        become established and disseminate. Including its ability to
        compete with or displace other plants. The PI should consider
        the hazards associated with inserted genetic elements,
        particularly if this codes for any toxic products that might
        affect the ecosystem or animal health.
    2.  The PI should also consider the potential for transfer of
        genetic material between the GM plant and other organisms.

#### Obtaining advice on the risk assessment

It is required that the PI carrying out a contained use risk assessment
should seek advice on the risk assessment from the Safety Committee
(SC). The PI should contact the BSO to begin this process. The SC will
review the risk assessment and work with the PI to ensure the risk
assessment is adequate.

#### Finalising a contained use risk assessment

Once the SC is happy that the contained use risk assessment is adequate,
the directors of Manchester Biological Laboratories Ltd. will approve the
commencement of work on the project. Physical and electronic copies of
the written risk assessment must be filed in the appropriate places.

The BSO is responsible for keeping the written risk assessment for the
required 10 year period.

### Assessing the risks involved in the use of chemicals and reagents

The principal investigator should check whether a required chemical or
reagent for their project is already in use in the laboratory. If not
they should locate the relevant MSDS for the substance in question and
should pay particular attention to the following factors:

1.  How should the substance be handled? Is particular PPE required, and
    is this available?
2.  How is the substance stored and can this be accommodated in the
    laboratory? For example, it may not be practical to store highly
    volatile, flammable, corrosive or controlled substances on site.
3.  How should the substance be disposed of? Primarily, can this be
    disposed of down the drain (diluted or undiluted?) or are special
    disposal measures required? If so are these available?

### Assessing the risks involved in the use of instrumentation and equipment

The principal investigator should assess any risk presented by
instrumentation or equipment brought into the lab for the purpose of
carrying out this project.

Some examples might be: does it operate at high temperature or pressure,
produce wavelengths of light that might be harmful (i.e uses lasers or
UV bulbs), does it operate at high voltages (e.g electroporator),
produce high frequency sounds that might be damaging to hearing (e.g
sonicators) or might be heavy or awkward to operate.

The principal investigator should check the SOP documentation for
information covering similar devices, and the information covering the
laboratory safety induction which should cover most of the installed
devices at the time of writing.
