## Purpose

Maintenance and Cleaning are fundamental to the operation of a safe and
successful biolab. This document provides the daily, weekly and ad-hoc
procedures that are in place.

## Scope

-   This SOP applies to all users in all circumstances in the LBL biolab
    without exception.
-   In the case of specific instructions for Maintenance and Cleaning of
    equipment the user should defer to the relevant SOP for that
    particular piece of equipment.

## Responsibilities

-   All users of the biolab are responsible for ensuring the clean and
    safe operation of equipment, lab furniture and tools.
-   The Biological Safety Officer has oversight and responsibility to
    make final decisions regarding maintenance and cleaning.

There are risks associated with certain cleaning products. Bleach is
considered a hazardous substance and care must be taken to follow the
instructions on the label.

It is the user\'s responsibility to check the MSDS for any chemical or
cleaning products they are using.

## Materials

The following items should be available in the lab

-   Disposable Nitrile gloves in various sizes
