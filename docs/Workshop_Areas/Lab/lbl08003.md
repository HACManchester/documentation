## Purpose

Even under ideal conditions it is inevitable that accidents will happen.
However if the correct procedure is followed, and spillage incidents
handled in a calm and sensible manner, there should be no risk of loss
of containment of microbes and no impact on biosafety risk to users of
the lab.

## Scope

This procedure is relevant for all users working with micro organisms in
the biolab. This procedure is applicable to both non-GMO and GMO
scenarios.

The microbes that are in use in the biolab are categorized as Biological
Agents as being unlikely to cause human disease (hazard group 1). In the
GMO context, the microbes are considered to be of no or negligible risk
to human health and the environment.

Therefore the primary immediate risk from spillage are as follows:

-   Injury from Broken glassware
-   Electric shocks from electrical devices.
-   Slipping and falling on wet patches.

It is however imperative that the lab user maintain containment of
microbes particularly GMO during a spillage, and this document describes
the equipment and procedure available to ensure this is the case.

## Responsibilities

The lab user is responsible for their own safety and that of others in
the vicinity during any protocol or procecure they are carrying out.

-   It is the lab user\'s responsibility to be familiar with these
    procedures, and be able to deal with a spillage of any microbe they
    are working with.
-   It is the lab user\'s responsibility to record the incident in the
    lab day book.

## Materials

The Spill kit is maintained in the lab for use in containing spills. A
lab user dealing with a spills should find disposable gloves and eyewear
available from stock.

The spill kit contains

-   A bag of absorbent material such as sand
-   Spare gloves,
-   2 autoclave bags
-   Household bleach
-   bucket for temporary containment of broken glass, absorbent material
-   Mop

SOP:   Standard Operating Procedure

## Procedures

### Dealing with a spill of micro-organisms

1.  The operator should be wearing gloves and eye protection and a
    plastic apron.
2.  Absorbant material should be placed around the spill to prevent
    further spread.
3.  pore bleach liberally over spill.
4.  The remainder of the spill should be absorbed into blue roll.
5.  Once the spill is contained, the absorbant material and blue roll
    should be placed in an autoclave bag and transported to the
    autoclave.
6.  The waste and sand should then be treated as contaminated waste and
    processed as per [LBL04006 - Using the Autoclave for Waste
    Deactivation](lbl04006.md) .
7.  By now there should be no visible remaining spilled material. But a
    second stage of disinfection should be performed with 1% Virkon
    solution, leaving the Virkon in contact with the contaminated area
    for 10 minutes before wiping away with blue roll.
8.  The incident should be recorded in the day book.

### Restocking the spill kit

Please contact the BSO to notify which items need to be restocked in the
spill kit.
