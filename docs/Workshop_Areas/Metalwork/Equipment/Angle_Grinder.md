# Angle Grinder

## Overview

We have an angle grinder in the workshop. This is used for making cuts in metals.
This is to be only used within the weldy / grindy area, NOT the main metal work area, we have to avoid any particles entering into the lathe or milling machines.
## Notes

There is a packet of spare discs in the box with the grinder, as well as
the spanner for changing them. Remember that the discs wear with use -
if you're doing a lot of cutting (or cutting through something very
tough) and thus using a lot of discs, it would be polite to replace what
you use

## Safety

  * Find a way to fasten the part down, ether by clamps or vice
  * **DO NOT** use the grinder in the main metal work area, only the weldy grindy area next door.
  * Make sure to use the right type of disc for the job (don't grind with a cutting disc)
  * Wear lots of ppe, Gloves, Impact Googles, hearing protection, mask if grinding anything that would generate dust
  * No lone working
  * Don't overload / burn out the grinder by pushing it too hard (this happened with a dewalt one we had)
