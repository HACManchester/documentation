# Angle Grinder

## Overview

![](Angle_Grinder.jpeg "Angle_Grinder.jpeg")

We have an angle grinder in the workshop. This is used for making cuts
in metals.

Before use please take note of the following:

  - Find a way to fasten the part down
  - Make sure to use the right type of disc for the job (don't grind with a cutting disc)
  - Wear lots of ppe
  - No lone working
  - Don't overload / burn out the grinder by pushing it too hard (this happened with a dewalt one we had)

## Notes

There is a packet of spare discs in the box with the grinder, as well as
the spanner for changing them. Remember that the discs wear with use -
if you're doing a lot of cutting (or cutting through something very
tough) and thus using a lot of discs, it would be polite to replace what
you use
