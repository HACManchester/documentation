# Angle Grinder

## Overview

There is currently no angle grinder in the hackspace. 

## Notes

We used to have an angle grinder; however this was severely misused so the decision has been made to not currently provide one in the space due to the requirements to implement access control.
You are permitted to bring an angle grinder to use in the space as long as health and safety guidelines are followed and you use it safely. You may not leave the angle grinder in the space.

## Safety

  * Find a way to fasten the part down, ether by clamps or vice
  * **DO NOT** use the grinder in the main metal work area, only the weldy grindy area next door.
  * Make sure to use the right type of disc for the job (don't grind with a cutting disc)
  * Wear lots of ppe, Gloves, Impact Googles, hearing protection, mask if grinding anything that would generate dust
  * No lone working
  * Don't overload / burn out the grinder by pushing it too hard (this happened with a dewalt one we had)
