# **Herbert Junior Surface Grinder**


The surface grinder, affectionately known as Herbert, is in the fabrication room off to the right of the main metalwork room. This is an expensive precision machine on permanent loan and built in the 1950's, so please respect that and be gentle. Any questions, ask in the metalwork group and they will be happy to help. The surface grinder requires an in person induction to use.

The surface grinder is a finishing tool to perform finishing operations on metals and stone to provide a perfectly flat finish. This allows metalworkers to make things parallel and all sorts of other neat stuff. A surface grinder, like any other power tool can be dangerous if used incorrectly. 

We are currently developing the RA and inductions.

Before use please:

- Ensure that everything visually looks fine, switches, plugs, etc.
- Check the grinding wheel for damage or wear
- Ensure the grinding wheel guard is on (on the herbert this covers about 70% of the wheel)
- Dress the wheel as appropriate
- Ensure you know where the estop is
- Ensure the material is fastened in place with a vice

Some useage tips:

- Check grinding wheels before fitting them, and use the appropriate wheels when grinding.
- Take care with gummy materials that may require frequent wheel redressing
- File off any burrs BEFORE placing material on the magchuck. Damaging the magchuck will cost the maintainers time and compromise your work
- Clean the magnetic chuck before use with blue roll and IPA. Don't use water or anything else
- Check the wheel clears the work before powering up the grinder
- Run new wheels for a minute or so before engaging the work
- Never use the grinder before it reaches maximum rpm
- Stand off to the side during startup
- Never put anything else on the grinder surface
- Ensure the area has ventilation. The ventilation unit lives in the welding area

DO NOT: 

- Wear loose clothing, loose hair, or dangling jewelry
- Touch or interfere with the VFD settings
- Hit or shock the wheel in any way. This includes hitting it hard against the work whilst on or off. Crashes should be reported
- Do not touch the work or the chuck whilst the wheel is running
- Use a wheel for material it is not intended for
- Start Herbert without the guard in place
- Take too deep cuts. Start lightly and let the wheel warm up
- Jam anything into the wheel
- Reach round/over the wheel
