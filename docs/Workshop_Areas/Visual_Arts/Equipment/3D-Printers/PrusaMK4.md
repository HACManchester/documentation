## Using the Prusa's without PrusaSlicer

It is perfectly fine if you want to use the Prusa's with a different slicer or [custom G-code.](https://fullcontrol.xyz/)

Simply visit the IP-Address from [Printer Connection Information](#printer-connection-information) to use [PrusaLink.](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/wi-fi-and-prusalink-setup-mk4-mk3-9-xl-mini-_413293#416077)
