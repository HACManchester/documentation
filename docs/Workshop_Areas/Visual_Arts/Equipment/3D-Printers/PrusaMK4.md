## Printing from PrusaSlicer

Pressing the button next to "export g code" will send your file to a physical printer, if it doesn't work make sure you have a physical printer selected and not a generic preset.

## Using the Prusa's **without** PrusaSlicer

It is perfectly fine if you want to use the Prusa's with a different slicer or [custom G-code.](https://fullcontrol.xyz/)

Simply visit the IP-Address from [Printer Connection Information](#printer-connection-information) to use [PrusaLink.](https://help.prusa3d.com/guide/wi-fi-and-prusalink-setup-mk4-mk3-9-xl-mini-_413293#416077)

Use "maker" as the username and the Prusa-Link key as the password.

| username | IP-Address   | Prusa-Link Key  |
| -------- | ------------ | --------------- |
| maker    | 172.16.0.123 | dmAPJnhhJ37VXBV |
| maker    | 172.16.0.124 | K2j5K9jNUwi4Aud |

## Changing filament

Use the knob on the printer and follow all instructions on the screen

Note: Do not pull the filament from the extruder!



## Notes:

There is a manual next to the printers which contains plenty of information on how to use the printers.
