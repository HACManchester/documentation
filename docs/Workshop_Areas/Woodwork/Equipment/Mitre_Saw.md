This saw uses a 255mm diameter blade and has a maximum cross cut of 300 x 60mm due to slide carriage. The Saw has a maximum mitre angle of 45/45&deg; and a maximum bevel angle of 45/0&deg; allowing for compound angles.

The Mitre Saw is mounted on the main workbench with the height set to allow for the surrounding bench to be utilised for support.  Members are required to ensure that when cutting, the material is firmly clamped in place.
