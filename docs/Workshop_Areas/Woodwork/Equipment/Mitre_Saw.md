As standard the space stocks replacement blades for these machines as listed on the consumables page.  Damaged and broken blades should be reported to the Woodwork Team so that replacements can be acquired asap.  If members wish they can buy specialised blades for the machine using the dimensions listed in the table above.

#### Evolution - RAGE3-S300
This Mitre Saw is mounted on the main workbench with the height set to allow for the surrounding bench top to be utilised for support.  Members are required to ensure that when cutting, the material is firmly clamped in place.

#### DeWalt - DW717XPS
This Mitre Saw is mounted on a portable frame with extendable roller supports.  The saw can be repositioned in the workshop to suit the requirement of the user, however it should be returned to its 'home' after use to keep the workshop tidy.  Members are required to ensure that when cutting, the material is firmly clamped in place.
