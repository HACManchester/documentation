### **Features**
The Pillar Drill is typically used to drill holes in wood, however the machine can be used for other materials.  This drill has a chuck with a maximum diameter of 13mm, a drill depth of xxxmm and an adjustable support table that can be repositioned to suit user requirements.  The drill has an operating speed range of 545 - 2530 RPM.  General guide to drill size & speed:

| Material    | 545   | 950  | 1470 | 1980 | 2530 |
|-------------|-------|------|------|------|------|
| Wood        | 31.75 | 25.4 | 22   | 16   | 9.5  |
| Soft Metals | 17.5  | 12.7 | 12   | 8.75 | 5.6  |
| Hard Metals | 12.5  | 9.5  | 6.4  | 4    | 2.4  |

(Soft metals = Aluminum, Brass, etc.) (Hard metals = Steel, etc.)

The Pillar Drill is mounted on the main workbench with the height set to allow for the surrounding bench to be utilised for support.  Built into the work bench is T-slot track that allows members to attach various accessories & stop blocks to the benches.  Members are reminded to ensure that when drilling, the workpiece is firmly clamped in place.

As standard the space stocks a variety of drill bits for use with this machine.  Damaged and broken bits should be reported to the Woodwork Team so that replacements can be acquired when necessary.  The space may have received specialist bits via donation over time, however these will not be replaced if damaged. Members requiring specialised drill bits not currently at the space will need to source them themselves.
