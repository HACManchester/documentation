As standard the space stocks replacement blades for these machines as listed on the consumables page.  Damaged and broken blades should be reported to the Woodwork Team so that replacements can be acquired asap.  If members wish they can buy specialised blades for the machine using the dimensions listed in the table above.

#### Scheppach - TS 2500
This table saw is a full size freestanding machine.  It has a precision ripping fence with turning fence rail, cross-cut/mitre gauge, saw blade guard, suction connector, push stick, push grip, assembly tool.

The optional sliding carriage table runs on triple sets of ball bearings in a torsion-resistant guide rail with a double round-rod guide. The related guide rail is available in two lengths: 1,400 mm for maximum cutting widths of 700 mm, and 2,000 mm for cutting widths up to 1,300 mm.  It is recommended that members utilise the sliding carriage when performing cross cuts as it provides support when feeding material though the saw and allows users to keep hands away from the blade.
