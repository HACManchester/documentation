3.	Use vee block when cutting round material

	This is a simple device that can be homemade which prevents round material from rotating and pulling your hand into the blade

4. Set the guard about 1cm from the top of the material to be cut

Cutting
-------

1.	Push the material through the blade steadily. Let the blade do the work. If it takes a long time the blade may be blunt and forcing it will just break it.
