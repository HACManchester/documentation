# Dust Extraction
## What is it for?

The newly installed dust extraction system has been installed to reduce the amount of wood dust in the air and ensure the machines do not get clogged with sawdust.

## Controls

### Switching it on and directing it

The extraction system is switched on using this dial

You can direct it to the tool you need through using the green and red paddles provided throughout the space. 

There are two central pipes that lead to each machine that is currently connected to the system.

Firstly, ensure that the pipe that leads to the machine you're using is open at the main divide here:

Then you switch it on and off for your machine where the pipe connects to it. For example, here is the paddle system for the lathe:

And here is the paddle system for the table saw:

You slide the paddles like this to open and close them:

For the smaller tools on the other wall, you use these paddles, which dictate which pipes are open and closed:

### Safety and Useage Notes

 - The extraction system cannot be used for both the lathe and the table saw at the same time
 - When using the dust extraction, you must use earphones
- You must not use the dust extraction system for metal
- When using hoses to connect machines to the extraction pipes, ensure they're not trip hazards or blocking exits
- Extraction should stay on for a few seconds after machine turns off so the dust has time to travel  
- When the extraction is switched on, ensure at least one gate is open so it isn't trying to pull a full vacuum
