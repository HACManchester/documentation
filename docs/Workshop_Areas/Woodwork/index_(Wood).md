### **Telegram**
WoodyDusty has a public Telegram group chat nicknamed [Got Wood?](http://protect-mylinks.com/decrypt?i=d354121e2215720)

Here members discuss all things related to WoodyDusty and woodworking as a whole.

### **Woodwork Team**
WoodyDusty is managed by the woodwork team.  Their responsibilities are:

* Attending woodwork meeting
* Assisting the Board & Sub-committees when required
* General upkeep & maintenance of equipment
* Managing stock of consumables and procuring more when necessary
* Managing training resources & member inductions

The woodwork team have a dedicated Telegram group chat that is intended as a more focused place for running the workshop.  This chat is managed by the board, if you would like to help out and join the Woodwork team simply email the board and they will be in touch.

### **Training**
Members are free to use the general hand tools in the space from the get-go, however for the larger equipment we ask that you complete an induction first.

Some equipment such as the Table Saw also has specific training available on Moodle which members are required to complete.  Training resources are written by members and as such are always open to feedback & improvement, if you have prior experience with the types of machines we have we'd welcome any help & support.

### **Safety**
Safety is one of our top priorities at the Hackspace.  We provide PPE in the workshop for members to use when required.  If you find any PPE is missing or damaged please contact the board asap either via Telegram or email.

Due to the nature of WoodyDusty it is common to find members using the equipment that requires PPE.  As such we recommend that all members within woodwork wear the appropriate PPE whenever equipment is being used.

PPE available in WoodyDusty:

- Goggles
- Ear Defenders
- Aprons
- Disposable Dust Masks*
