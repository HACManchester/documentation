## August 2019 

### STATUS - BOARD APPROVED OCT 2019

## OVERVIEW

This document is designed to formalise the training and induction process for members for equipment and area of the Hackspace. It is produced as guidance for those providing training to members and to implement a structure for requesting, receiving and recording training 

## TRAINING DEVELOPMENT
Each team (Woodworking, MetalWorking, Visual Arts, Laser, 3D Printing, etc) is responsible for designing the training/induction programme for the area or specific piece of equipment and updating the training module on Moodle (Which must be used for documenting all training resources). Alongside updating Moodle with induction sessions. Teams may choose to do this on an adhoc basis or organising regular induction sessions based on the availability of trainers. 
IMPORTANT:  Whilst teams have the authority to create, edit and implement their agreed rules on inductions and machine use no team must make membership of any telegram group (or any other chat/social app) MANDATORY as part of the induction. This is to ensure those who chose not to use apps like telegram are not excluded 

## MEMBER’S PROCESS
Member visit the Members System at https://members.hacman.org.uk and under tools and equipment selects the equipment that they wish to be trained on. Some equipment eg Bandsaw, Drill Press etc is covered as one training session under Woodworking Induction however this induction can be activated by selecting training on any of the equipment 
Once requested the member is automatically enrolled in the online induction for the equipment/group. They can access this by using their username and password for the members system on HacTrain at https://moodle.hacman.org.uk 
Member accesses the course which contains information relating to the induction alongside the Induction Scheduler for them to schedule a practical induction where required (e.g for woodworking, laser, 3D print) etc
Member attends the training (passes it) and completes online course and is free to use the equipment. 

## TRAINERS PROCESS

Trainer login to Moodle and makes sure there is training slots available that the member can sign up for (Based on Trainer’s Availability) 
Once the member has signed up for a slot the trainer attends and inducts the member on the equipment. 
If member passes the induction, trainer marks this on Moodle as complete. 

## RULES RELATING TO TRAINING

## Induction - How To

## Equipment Inductions

Inductions are required for various machines around the space including the laser cutter, 3D printer and the woodworking area. Our inductions are a mixture of face to face instructions and also online through our learning platform at [https://moodle.hacman.org.uk] (https://moodle.hacman.org.uk) To access this use your member system username and password. 

For a tool eg the Laser that requires an induction you should ensure using the tools & equipment page on the members system and simply click on the tool name under the tools & equipment page. Scroll down to the section that reads " To use this piece of equipment an access fee and an induction is required. The access fee goes towards equipment maintenance"" click the Pay Now button to pay the access fee  **EVEN IF THE ACCESS FEE IS £0 you must click the pay now button for the system to register you as requiring an induction**
