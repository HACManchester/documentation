## First Aid
The first aid kit and accident book are located in the kitchen. This includes bandages, burns kits, eye wash and a tourniquet. 

There is an auto-defibrillator by the entrance to the wood workshop, in the event someone has a cardiac arrest. You should call 999, and let them know you have a defibrillator. They will tell you whether to use it or not.

There is a smaller plaster dispenser by the main entrance.

Please fill in the accident report book for any health and safety incidents, or near misses.

## Police incident
In the event of a criminal act in progress, call 999.
If thereâ€™s been a break in or theft, please notify Hackspace's directors who can advise. board@hacman.org.uk

If the space cannot be secured, do what you can to secure it, even if this means boarding up a door to prevent further damage, and notify the board immediately.

## Fire
The fire alarm is a loud blaring sound, with red flashing lights.

CO2, powder and foam fire extinguishers are located around the space. Fight the fire if it is safe to do so.

Raise the alarm, by activating a call point if you pass one on your way out.

Close doors behind you and gather at the meeting point at the top of Cowal street (leave the space, turn left, it's the T-junction on your right).

If you believe there is a false alarm, please call our landlord on the number above.

## Flood
In the event of water escape, we have a shutoff in the CNC room, just off the woodworking room. The valve is blue and at the back of the room towards the ceiling. Turn this to isolate water to our unit.

If water is coming in from another unit, or isnâ€™t affected by the isolator valve, please contact the landlord on the number above.

If you can, and if it is safe to do so, try and contain water escape, and move items away from the water.
