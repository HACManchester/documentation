# Emergency procedures

Whilst a serious incident is unlikely in the space, we have procedures in place to keep you safe.

If an incident occurs whilst you're in the space, you should:

1. Move to somewhere safe and help others to do the same
2. Notify others in the space who might not be aware of the incident
3. Contact our [emergency contacts](#contacts) and follow their instructions

## First aid

First aid equipment, including a burns kit and eye wash, are located in the kitchen. There is also a defibrilator at the entrance to the wood workshop and a plaster dispenser at the main entrance.

If someone suffers a life-threatening illness or injury, call 999 and ask for Ambulance. You will be connected to [North West Ambulance Service](https://www.nwas.nhs.uk) (NWAS), who will ask questions about the person and their condition, and tell you what to do next.

However, if their condition is not life-threatening, you can call [NHS 111](tel:+44111) or visit [111 online](111.nhs.uk).

Once the person is receiving care, please record the incident in the accident report book in the kitchen.

## Fire safety

If you discover a fire, activate the fire alarm using one of the red break-glass call points around the space.

When you hear the fire alarm, you should:

1. Stop and turn off any equipment that you're using
2. Leave immediately by the nearest available exit, closing doors behind you
3. Go to our assembly point at the top of Cowan Street (to the left of the main entrance)

When you arrive at the assembly point, you should:

1. Make sure that everyone who's known to be in the space has left
2. Call 999, ask for Fire & Rescue, and give them [our address](#contacts)
3. Contact our [emergency contacts](#contacts) and follow their instructions

Once [Greater Manchester Fire & Rescue Service](https://www.manchesterfire.gov.uk) (GMFRS) arrive, you should give them:

1. The location of the fire, if you know it
2. Names and descriptions of anybody who's missing
3. Details of any risks or hazards, such as equipment that you weren't able to stop

Do not re-enter the building until you're told by GMFRS that it's safe to do so.

## Utilities

If there's a water leak, go to the back of the CNC room behind the woodwork room, and turn the blue stop-tap towards the ceiling at the back of the room. This will isolate the water supply to the space.

If you need to isolate the electricity supply, you'll find circuit breakers in the following locations:

- Wood workshop: Member storage area, in a grey steel cabinet above shelf A1
- Rest of the space: Back of the visual arts area in a beige steel cabinet

Once it's safe to do so, contact our [emergency contacts](#contacts) and follow their instructions.

## Crimes and personal safety

If your safety is at risk, such as a crime happening now, call 999 and ask for Police.

In the event of a break-in or damage to the building, do what you can to secure the space, such as boarding up a door.

Once it's safe to do so, contact our [emergency contacts](#contacts) and follow their instructions.

## Local incidents

It's likely that the space will be affected if there's a major incident in the local area, but particularly so given our proximity to the Etihad Campus.

If there's a major incident in the local area, the emergency services will respond using robust and tested plans to keep everyone safe.

If you become aware of such an incident, you should consider staying in the space until you're sure that the local area is safe.

Once it's safe to do so, contact our [emergency contacts](#contacts) and follow their instructions.

## Emergency contacts {#contacts}

If there's a risk to life, property or the environment, call the emergency services on 999. Don't assume that someone else has already done so.

- Call our landlord on [0161 974 3232](tel:+441619743232), if the incident affects the safety or integrity of the building
