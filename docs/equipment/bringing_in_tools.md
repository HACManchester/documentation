# Bringing in Tools
Members may wish to bring in their own equipment and tools for use in the space. If an item already exists in the space then it is likely covered by our risk assessments. If your item presents no additional risks then it can be used in the space.

If there is not an equivalent tool in the space then the board of directors must be consulted before you can bring the tool into the space. We will likely ask you to provide us with a risk assessment.

Example: A member wishing to bring in their own power drill will likely be covered by our power drill risk assessment. Meanwhile a member bringing in a plasma cutter would not be, as though we have tools to cut metal, a plasma cutter has different risks than a bandsaw.

Note: If you bring in your own tools, as well as the above, you are solely responsible for the tool, and are liable for anyone you allow to use your tools or anyone who comes to harm because of tools you have brought into the space, therefore do not leave your tools lying around.
