Vee block
---------

Use a v-block when cutting round material

This is a simple device that can be homemade which prevents round material from rotating and pulling your hand into the blade. Please watch the video below to see why this is necessary.

Setting the guard
-----------------

Set the guard about 1cm from the top of the material to be cut.

This allows the material to pass through, but gives the maximum protection for your hands. Consider also that the blade may break and in that case it is important it remains inside the machiney break and in that case it is important it remains inside the machine rather than causing injury. The more of the blade is covered by guards, the less risk is posed.
