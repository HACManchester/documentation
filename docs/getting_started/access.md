# Access

## Keyfob Access
To access the space for the first time independently (not on a tour) you will need to register an RFID fob. Fobs are available in the space by the registration computer (in front of you when you enter the space). They are typically plastic disks on a key ring. At the time of writing they are yellow plastic discs.

To add an RFID tag to your account, log into <https://members.hacman.org.uk> and click "Set up an access method" or "[number of] access methods" in the bar at the top of the page.

***Note your Fob Will Not Work Until you have completed this induction and ticked the box at the bottom***

Scroll to the bottom of the Edit Your Details area, click on the white box under the text and scan your fob with the reader connected to the sign up PC (or any compatible phone or rfid reader you have lying around) to enter your fob UID then click Add a new fob to save this.

### Mobile phone Registration

You can also use a compatible mobile phone to register a fob by simply using any 13.5mhz rfid tag, reading the id of that fob and entering it into the field below on the membership system

## Access Code
The space can also be accessed with an access code. The code can be used at anytime, but is particularly useful if the RFID system fails, or you lose your fob and need to collect another.

Scroll to the bottom of the Edit Your Details area, click on 'Request access code' and your pincode will be displayed at the top of your profile when the page refreshes.

Note: New members must come to the space for a tour and to collect and register a fob before they will be able to request an access code.
