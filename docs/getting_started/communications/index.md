## Forum
The Forum is the go-to place to join hackspace discussions. This can be used for everything from showing off your latest project, to reporting a faulty piece of equipment. We also use this for admin announcements, posting events, maintenance updates, scheduling inductions and purchase proposals.

The forum uses a single sign-on from the [members portal](https://members.hacman.org.uk), so you do not need to create new login credentials.

## Telegram
Informal and quick moving discussion such as ‘where do we keep screws’ or chatting about an idea you're developing. Telegram is a messaging app similar to Whatsapp. The conversation is split into several topics.

## Calendar
Our Google Calendar is kept up to date with all the events happening in any month. It also features a handy Etihad match day reminder so you don't get caught out by the football traffic.
