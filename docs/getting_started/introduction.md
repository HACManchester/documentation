# Introduction
Hackspace Manchester is a place for people who like to make things.

We are a community workshop. We have a diverse community of 300 members, from all walks of life and with all sorts of skills. We have guidelines and rules to keep things running
smoothly for everyone.

Please take time to read through this wiki, though a cursory glance through this getting started page, as well as our rules should get you off to a good start.

## What is Hackspace?
Hackspace is a thing we do together. Itâ€™s a makerspace run by its community for its community.

Manchester Hackspace is just one of many spaces in the UK. Each space is run independently by its members. The aim of hackspace is to provide members with the tools they need to get making and for us, it is broadly split into four areas:
* Wood - Saws, sanders, drills, routers, etc.
* Metal - Lathes, drills, mills, hand tools, welding, grinding, guillotines, sheet benders
* Electronics - Soldering stations, Oscilloscopes, etc.
* Visual Arts - Laser cutter, heat press, sewing machines, general arts and crafts tools.

As well as these four main categories there is also:
* Snackspace/Parkspace - Food prep facilities, tuck shop, chill out area & main first aid point.
* 3D printer land - A range of state of the art FDM 3D printers
* Biolab - a sanitary space with a flow hood, can also be used as a photographic dark room.
* Bikespace - a bicycle repair area with a small selection of purchasable items.
* Members Storage - for storing active project items. See the storage rules for more information.
* General area - tables, chairs, PCs, informative books, board games, dust sheets.
