# Managing Your Membership

Your membership is managed via the self-service [membership portal](https://members.hacman.org.uk).
This is the same portal you used to sign up and set up your direct debit when you joined.

From the portal you can:
* Complete your online induction
* Set up a key fob (and pin access code)
* Edit your direct debit amount
* Cancel your membership
* Apply for tool inductions
* Keep your address up to date (legal requirement - see our [terms and conditions](https://docs.hacman.org.uk/governance/rules/membership_t_and_cs/)).
