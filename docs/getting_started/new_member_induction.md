# New Member Induction 
All members must complete their online induction on the [membership system](https://members.hacman.org.uk), as well as an in person open evening tour.

The open evening tour serves as a general, space-wide induction that covers a lot of the basics, it takes about 40 minutes to complete. See the [Visit Us](https://www.hacman.org.uk/visit-us/) for more information about the open evening tours.

You will be given a password at the end of the tour to allow you to finish signing up, and to register a fob and enter the space.
