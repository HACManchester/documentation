# Who's who?
Manchester Hackspace is managed by its board of directors, also know as 'The Board'.

**The Board** are volunteer members voted in every two years at the AGM and are the legal directors of Manchester Makers Limited, our legal company name.

**Area Coordinators** manage volunteer requirements for the different areas of the space. We encourage everyone to help out around the space, be it a few minutes of chores each time you visit, or an hour or two a month helping with training.

**Members** covers everyone else at the space. They're the people who get things done, make things and help the Board and area coordinators keep the space running smoothly.
