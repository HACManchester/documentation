# Who's who?
Manchester Hackspace is managed by its board of directors, also know as 'The Board'.

**The Board of Directors** are volunteer members voted in every two years at the AGM and are the legal directors of Manchester Makers Limited, our legal company name. The Board keep Hackspace open, ensuring critical issues are solved, providing oversight over Hackspace and making sure the wheels keep turning. They also manage the finances of the space and respond to membership queries. 

**Area Coordinators** manage volunteers, supplies and training for the different areas of the space. We encourage everyone to help out around the space, be it a few minutes of chores each time you visit, or an hour or two a month helping with training. Area Coordinators are the first point of contact if you're wanting to make changes to any of the workshop areas.

**Members** covers everyone else at the space. They're the people who get things done, make things and help the board and area coordinators keep the space running smoothly.
