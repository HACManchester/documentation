        association by or on behalf of that person.

    2.  An appointment under a proxy notice may be revoked by delivering
        to the association a notice in writing given by or on behalf of

    3.  becomes incapable by reason of mental disorder, illness or

 ####   Remuneration of Directors


32. The directors must not be paid any remuneration unless it is

 ####   Proceedings of Directors

33. 1.  The Directors may from time to time specify a web based system
        (“the Governance System”) for recording and managing their
        decision making process.

    2.  The Governance System must:

        1.  permit any director to create a proposal that is then
            available for viewing (on presentation of suitable
            credentials) by all directors and any member of the
            Association;

        2.  after a proposal has been created, send it promptly to each
            director’s email address;

        3.  maintain one or more rules as to the period (“the voting
            period”) within which any proposal must be accepted or
            rejected, which may vary from proposal to proposal;

        4.  during the voting period, permit any director to indicate
            whether they accept or reject the proposal;

        5.  record the votes cast by each director;

        6.  record that a proposal has been “passed” if the requisite
            number of directors have indicated their acceptance of the
            proposal via the governance system;

        7.  permit the recording of minutes; and

        8.  maintain a current contact email address for each director
            (“the director’s email address”).

    3.  Any proposal that has been recorded as “passed” by the
        Governance System shall be treated as a decision of the
        directors.

34. 1.  Decisions of the directors may be made either:

        1.  by the use of the Governance System; or

        2.  by a written resolution in accordance with the procedure
            described below.

    2.  All directors’ decisions must be made in one of these two ways,
        and a decision made in any other way will be ineffective.

    3.  A majority of the directors must accept a proposal made using
        the Governance System or a written resolution before it is
        passed.

35. A written resolution may be passed if:

    1.  the text of the resolution is circulated to all directors in
        writing; and

    2.  the requisite number of directors have given to all the other
        directors in writing their agreement to the text of the
        resolution.

36. 1.  The directors may delegate any of their powers or functions
        concerning the day to day management of the affairs of the
        Company to any person or persons as they may from time to time
        select.

    2.  All acts done by a director shall, even if it is afterwards
        discovered that there was a defect in their appointment or that
        they were disqualified from holding office or had vacated
        office, be as valid as if such person had been duly appointed
        and was qualified and had continued to be a director.

    3.  Where on any particular occasion more than 2 directors, in the
        course of their office as directors, discuss the affairs of the
        Company by any means, whether in person or otherwise, a minute
        shall be made and recorded indicating:

        1.  when the discussion took place;

        2.  the identities of the directors involved; and

        3.  the substance of the discussion.

    4.  Minutes of directors meetings:

        1.  may be held in electronic form, and in particular using the
            Governance System;

        2.  must be held for ten years from the date of the discussion
            in accordance with section 248 of the Companies Act 2006.

 ####   Delegation


37. 1.  The directors may delegate any of their powers or functions to a
        committee of two or more directors but the terms of any
        delegation must be recorded in the minute book.

    2.  The directors may impose conditions when delegating, including
        the conditions that:

        1.  the relevant powers are to be exercised exclusively by the
            committee to whom they delegate;

        2.  no expenditure may be incurred on behalf of the association
            except in accordance with a budget previously agreed with
            the directors.

    3.  The directors may revoke or alter a delegation.

    4.  All acts and proceedings of any committees must be fully and
        promptly reported to the directors.

  ####  Declaration of Directors’ Interests


38. [directors-interests] A director must declare the nature and extent
    of any interest, direct or indirect, which he or she has in a
    proposed transaction or arrangement with the association or in any
    transaction or arrangement entered into by the association which has
    not previously been declared. A director must absent himself or
    herself from any discussions of the directors in which it is
    possible that a conflict will arise between his or her duty to act
    solely in the interests of the association and any personal interest
    (including but not limited to any personal financial interest).

 ####   Conflicts of Interests


39. 1.  If a conflict of interests arises for a director because of a
        duty of loyalty owed to another organisation or person and the
        conflict is not authorised by virtue of any other provision in
        the articles, the unconflicted directors may authorise such a
        conflict of interests where the following conditions apply:

        1.  the conflicted director is absent from the part of the
            meeting at which there is discussion of any arrangement or
            transaction affecting that other organisation or person;

        2.  the conflicted director does not vote on any such matter and
            is not to be counted when considering whether a quorum of
            directors is present at the meeting; and

        3.  the unconflicted directors consider it is in the interests
            of the association to authorise the conflict of interests in
            the circumstances applying.

    2.  [conflict-interest-loyalty] In this article a conflict of
        interests arising because of a duty of loyalty owed to another
        organisation or person only refers to such a conflict which does
        not involve a direct or indirect benefit of any nature to a
        director.

 ####   Validity of Directors’ Decisions


40. 1.  [directors-validity] Subject to article
        [directors-validity-void], all acts done by a meeting of
        directors, or of a committee of directors, shall be valid
        notwithstanding the participation in any vote of a director:

        1.  who was disqualified from holding office;

        2.  who had previously retired or who had been obliged by the
            constitution to vacate office;

        3.  who was not entitled to vote on the matter, whether by
            reason of a conflict of interests or otherwise; if without:

        4.  the vote of that director; and

        5.  that director being counted in the quorum; the decision has
            been made by a majority of the directors at a quorate
            meeting.

    2.  [directors-validity-void] Article [directors-validity] does not
        permit a director to keep any benefit that may be conferred upon
        him or her by a resolution of the directors or of a committee of
        directors if, but for article [directors-validity], the
        resolution would have been void, or if the director has not
        complied with article [directors-interests].

 ####   Minutes

41. The directors must keep minutes of all:

    1.  appointments of officers made by the directors;

    2.  proceedings at meetings of the association;

    3.  meetings of the directors and committees of directors including:

        1.  the names of the directors present at the meeting;

        2.  the decisions made at the meetings; and

        3.  where appropriate the reasons for the decisions.

  ####  Accounts

42. 1.  The directors must prepare for each financial year accounts as
        required by the Companies Acts. The accounts must be prepared to
        show a true and fair view and follow accounting standards issued
        or adopted by the Accounting Standards Board or its successors
        and adhere to the recommendations of applicable Statements of
        Recommended Practice.
