## 6, Rights of Individuals
6.1 Under the UK’s data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), individuals have the right on request to receive a copy of the personal data that  Manchester Makers Ltd holds about them, including CCTV recordings if they are recognisable.

6.2 Members have the right to request all information held about them be deleted, though this may affect their eligibility to continue membership of Manchester Hackspace. This right does not take precedence over our legal responsibilities detailed in 2.3, nor that detailed in 3.2.

6.3 Should they discontinue their membership, their data should be stored for up to three years, in case of their return, after which point it should be deleted.

6.4 To access any data relating to a member, they must make a written request to the directors: board@hacman.org.uk.

6.4.1 We should aim to respond within 28 days of any request, however this may increase to 90 days where a request is complex. In this case, they should be notified of the delay.

6.4.2 There should not usually be a charge for such a request, but we may charge an administrative fee if the request is thought to be manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive.

6.4.3 We should always determine whether disclosure of recordings or information will reveal third-party information, as there is no right to access data relating to other people. In this case, we may refuse the request if it would otherwise involve an unfair intrusion into the privacy of others.

6.4.4 Should CCTV footage be required as evidence of a crime, we should ask for the email address of the case officer as well as the crime reference number to submit the evidence to. If the police wish to collect the footage themselves, members can request that we freeze the data to avoid its automatic deletion in the meantime.

6.4.5 Under no circumstances should footage be provided featuring other members. We should also avoid providing descriptions of CCTV footage to members, instead mediating the situation that has occured.

6.4.6 As an example Manchester Makers Ltd could be held liable if we provide CCTV footage, or a description of something recorded, that then results in a member assaulting another member.

## 7. Where is personal data stored and who can access it?
7.1 Personal data is stored on a secure membership database. It is visible to and used by the directors and those appointed to help manage digital infrastructure. Information may also be stored on directors’ or appointed persons’ personal computers, servers and paper files. Wherever possible this is encrypted or password protected. Paper files should be stored securely and shredded when done with.

7.2 Information shall only be held by a director while they hold office or volunteer while they hold a position. All membership data should be deleted or securely returned to the directors when it is no longer needed or the position is vacated.

# 8. Additional Information in relation to CCTV

Cameras should only be positioned to cover communal or public areas on the premises and such that they provide clear images. No camera is to be positioned inside toilets, shower facilities, or changing rooms. 

8.1.3 All cameras should be clearly visible and no covert recording is permitted in Hackspace.

8.1.4 Appropriate signs should be prominently displayed so that members, the public and other visitors are aware they are entering an area covered by CCTV.

9.3 A monitor has been provided by the main exit of Hackspace to allow members a real-time view of an external analogue CCTV. This monitor does not store any data, and members cannot use this to access any recordings.

## 10. Access to and Disclosure of Data
10.1 Access to the CCTV digital storage is restricted to two directors of Manchester Makers Ltd at any time, who each have a separate login to the system. Remote access is available to the two designated directors.

10.2 In certain cases, the directors may ask the opinion of a more experienced third party, authorising the disclosure of relevant recordings in accordance with the purposes stated above.
