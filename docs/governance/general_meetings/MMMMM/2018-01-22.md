### Submissions from afar 
* Four thoughts on general space safety (from Phil C, so if they are gibberish please message me over telegram :D)
  * '''Emergency Stops for Woody Dusty Benches''' Let's put some emergency stops in, in place of the switches in the woody dusty area. From how the benches are currently wired, we should be able to use 100mm by 100mm emergency stops rated at 10 amps (e.g. these http://uk.farnell.com/siemens/3su1801-0na00-2ac2/emergency-stop-sw-spst-nc-500v/dp/2695606). I'm happy to do what ever planning etc is needed, but I'm not an electrician so someone else would need to do the actual install.
  * '''Isolator for Wood Lathe''' Given the risk profile of the wood lathe, before it is put live could we put the power supply through an isolator (e.g. this: http://uk.farnell.com/imo-precision-controls/pe69-3020/isolator-encl-ip65-3pole/dp/9940863) that can be locked off with a combination lock? People would only be given the code to the combination lock once they were fully inducted. 
  * '''Emergency Stops in Other Areas''' We might want to look at other places where emergency stops would be useful - e.g. one for electronics bench and a couple in weldy grindy?
  * '''Portable Appliance Testing''' Is there anybody in the space (or do who we know anyone) who could lend us a calibrated PAT machine? If so, could they provide the training needed for the space to use it over a weekend so that we can PAT everything with a plug (that needs it)?

* When large changes, such as areas of the hackspace and tools/equipment movement need to be discussed, such as the move of craft space, it should be submitted to the agenda to allow members who cannot be at the MMMM to give input (and not brought forward in AOB or as part of another point without that point being fleshed out in the agenda). This should allow members to contribute even if they can't be at meetings, and give insight into discussions such as the reason for the location of tools, requirements for specific workspaces, etc. Without this, a MMMM could push through decisions from a few people without the ability for other members to contribute. It could also mean that work that has been done in a well meaning way could have to be repeatedly modified due to unintended consequences that could have been mitigated with other members input.

* Craft area and plastic forming
  * Crafts moved to centre of the hackspace for better accessibility, old area is now plastic forming area
    * The new positioning of the craft area has a number of significant problems
      * The increase in dust around the sewing machines is significant
        * This was a significant factor in moving these machines far away. This may well reduce the lifespan of the sewing machines and increase their need to be sent out for maintenance. While the dust covers Lucy made for them work fairly well, they aren't designed to deal with this level of dust.
        * Any fabric projects will require the craft desk to be wiped down before use, whereas the desk in the corner stayed relatively dust controlled.
        * Things like knitting wool, thread, etc, are dust sensitive and nearly impossible to safely wash before they are made into a project. Putting these in such a dusty area of the space could loose us a fair amount of bought or donated consumables on a regular basis.
        * The craft area is now far away from the storage of items used for crafting - like the leather, fabric, paints, etc, and many of these can't be easily moved to the area without risking them with lots of dust.

## Proceedings
### Start
* 19:30:00 Meeting starts
* 19:30:07 Iain's phone rings
* 19:30:24 Meeting adjourned as food order has arrived with impeccable timing
* Due to the quantity of text in the agenda, printouts were provided for members to view at their own leisure to save the Chair's voice.

### Approval of previous minutes
Approved.

### Reports from teams
* Board: Not a positive gain of members in December, financially main losses were snackspace and the skip. Snackspace loss is because bank run wasn't done until January. We are at about 108 members. Typical pattern of cancellations in Dec/Jan so while we are down it isn't something to worry about. Still neeidng more members. Currently aiming to get 3 months rent in bank for when we need a deposit for any new space in the future. 
* Craft: none given.
* Laser: Pew Pew. Couple more maintainers required, to keep optics clean and working well. The lens is coming to its end of life. __ACTION (LASER TEAM): order two lenses__
* 3D: All going well, hot end on printer getting tempermental. 
  * Filament is now on sale from the space at 4p/gram - see box with appropraite sign. Scales and separate money pot are provided.
  * __ACTION (3D PRINTER USERS): If you have filament stored at space, ensure it is marked with your name or stored in your own member storage.__
    * Anything without a label will eventually be removed and become space filement.
* Documentation: Requirements for wiki discussed and documented, team as a whole need to sign off on them, to then seek wider feedback from the space. Team is seeking less technical people to give their viewpoint. 
* Procurement: Heavy month with two snackspace runs being done due to miscommunication. Process has been improved, team members to check stock before doing a run. Suggestion board still there, please use it!
* Electrical: Cable trays are up. Qualified electrician (and member) has assessed the space as to what would be best in terms of proper wiring. Quality of his work was emphasised. __ACTION (CONE): Follow up for quote__
* Events: 
  * Rossy: "Oh!"
  * Maker Faire confirmed! :tada: 
    * Doodle is on the forum for people who want to sign up and help out. __ACTION (ALL): If interested, sign up!__
    * 27th - 29th April
    * Awesome fun 
  * Manchester MakeFest moved to 27th May, not announced formally yet.
  * Liverpool MakeFest also registered for!
  * Merits of Liverpol discussed.

### Member Submitted Items

### Submissions from afar
* Space Safety
  * Emergency Stops in Woody Dusty (WD)
    * General approval, great idea and the benches were initially designed to accommodate them
    * Benches may need swapping around to locate e-stops in the middle, currently the place where they would be is on the outside edges. 
    * __ACTION (ELECTRICAL TEAM): Spec out what would be needed for e-stops.__
  * Wood Lathe Isolator
    * Lock out switch with combination lock, only trained users can be given the code, prevent inexperienced users even trying to use it.

  * PAT TESTING (yes, PA testing testing)
    * We have a tester, but it isn't calibrated and can't do Class II tests. 
    * What type of test is required?
      * We should do regular visual inspections of equipment
      * Bob doesn't have faith in humanity
      * Cone points out the since fixed extension reel with exposed copper and neutral just resting on connector.Importance of checking equipment raised.
      * Depending on pricing we could get things tested in the space

  * *odd noise outside*
* Large Changes 
  * What constitutes a large change? Discussion on this and came down to reversible/irreversible changes.
  * Comment that people can just come in, any day and just move stuff around, we can't rule against that
  * MMMM doesn't hold any particular power, comment on the aims of the MMMM.
  * Discussion over whether this is a Rule 1 issue. 
  * Asking teams about things in their remit is a good idea and should be done. 
    * Teams with minority of members at MMMM should refer to wider team if controversial.
  * Discussion on inertia at the space - if there is too much inertia people will just do it anyway and ignore process
  * Discussion on concensus, what it means per definition vs what it means in hackspaces
  * *odd noises that definitely aren't large rats*
  * Duscussion on allowing things to be deferred by one, and only one, month and then decision at next MMMM
  * Examples of why would be:
    * If a minority of a team present that it affects
    * If it is controversial and needs further discussion 
    * Should be posted to the forum for discussion by all
  * Discussions in AOB should not happen immediately with some cooldown.
    * Bikeshedding commences over cutoff times for submitting items to agenda, including what would happen with leap seconds.
  * General outcome is for agenda cutoff for the Friday before
    * Advisory items can be added after this (such as "New Team Social")
    * Action items ("let's do something!") should be before cutoff
    * If you haven't had 48h before meeting to get opinion in, then you must have 48h after minutes are published to form opinion or defer.

    * __ACTION (MINUTE TAKER): post minutes on forum__
  * General agreement on the 48h deliberation. If less than 48h then it can be deferred via forum thread.
  * *chair breathes*
* Dust
  * This point appeared to a complaint and so while acknowledged, no useful way to mitigate other than placing things in boxes.
  * Suggestions:
    * Put things that are sensitive to dust in closed boxes
    * Dust levels are consistent between areas of the space
    * We can put a door closer on WD to mitigate as much as we can. Approved and just needs doing.  __ACTION (ANY): Buy and fix door closer to WD__
