# Asbestos

Please see the pdfs below for our own asbestos survey of the space alongside the wider asbestos survey for the entire building as carried out by the landlords

[Wellington House Full Survey - 2018](asbestos_wellingtonhouse.pdf)


[Hackspace Manchester Survey - 2019](asbestos_hacman.pdf) - Carried out by 0800 Asbestos. 

Summary: There is no high or medium risk asbestos in the space. There are a number of old electrical boxes around the space which have been marked as low risk asbestos. Members are unlikely to come into contact with these in the course of general use of the space.
