# Health & Safety Policy

Creating a safe work environment is all of our responsibilities. You have a personal responsibility to be safe, as well as a responsibility to everybody else.

We understand things break and accidents happen in the space. The most important thing is that we can learn from them, and improve our training and processes. Please report near misses or accidents in the accident report book at the kitchen first aid station.

Being safe goes beyond just using tools safely. It includes managing dust and fumes from your project, cleaning up after yourself and storing things correctly. If in doubt, please ask someone.

Unfortunately there will always be some tasks which simply are not suitable for our windowless hackspace.

## Wear PPE
Hackspace provides a basic array of PPE for use at the space. You must use any PPE stated as required on the [tool page](https://members.hacman.org.uk/equipment) on the membership system.

If the PPE provided is broken, in poor condition or not there, please email board@hacman.org.uk or inform an area coordinator immediately so stock can be replenished.

## Look Out for One Another
Be aware of your surroundings and communicate risks with others. Let others know if they need to keep a distance from you while you use a tool.

If you are about to use a tool that needs ear defenders, dust masks or other PPE, let others around you know and give them chance to get their own.

If you see someone about to/doing something unsafe, stop them as soon as it is safe to do so. If you feel comfortable, offer to teach them how to use the tool safely.

If they continue to use the tool in an unsafe way, ask them to stop using it and if necessary fill in the  [Complaints Form](https://forms.gle/HC2xJrz1XcXx4W1w7).


## Using Tools
**If you do not feel competent to use a tool, do not use it.**
 * If there are others around who are competent, see if they'd be willing to show you how to use a tool.
 * Take a break, make a brew and watch some youtube videos to learn how to use something properly.
 * Use the great selection of books in the space which form a fantastic learning resource.
 * Ask on the forum if anyone would be willing to meet you and show you how to use the tool.

 You should familiarise yourself with the risks of any tool before you use it. Risk assessments for each tool can be found in the red health and safety folder by the sign up desk, or in our [digital risk assessment folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1gNdDUavZLfXFX8dfru6wcbcLSanm1Sv-?usp=sharing)

### Tool Inductions
Some tools require an induction. This is typically tools that are either complex to use, expensive or can cause damage quickly. You can find out if a tool requires an induction, as well as apply for one on the [tool page](https://members.hacman.org.uk/equipment) on the membership system.

Do not use a tool if you are not inducted on it and it requires one.

### Check the condition of the equipment you're about to use.
* If it has a label saying "Do Not Use" then Do Not Use it!
* Does it appear to be in working order?
* Are any power cables damaged? 
* Are all shields in place and secured?
* Does the emergency stop button work?

### Tag damaged or unsafe equipment out of use
* A piece of paper with "Do Not Use" is sufficient, with reason why.
* Let others know by posting a topic on the [forum](https://list.hacman.org.uk/c/broken-tools-maintenance-logs/broken-tools/61).

### Clean up after yourself
* Remove all hazards for the next person wanting to use this tool.
* Sweep or mop the floor.

## Lone working
Some tools are categorised as 'No Lone Working'. These are typically tools that could cause significant damage to you, meaning you wouldn't be able to get help.

All of these tools are induction protected, and you will be informed during the induction if this applies. You can also check the [tool page](https://members.hacman.org.uk/equipment) on the membership system.

Some examples include: Table saw, all mitre saws, metal mill, CNC mill, all lathes.

If you are using a no lone working tool, you must find a 'safety partner', and inform them you will be using a no lone working tool. They do not have to be in the same room as you, but they must be able to hear you, and you should also make sure they are understand how to stop the machine in an emergency.

If at any point your safety partner leaves, they must inform you and you will either need to find another, or stop work if there is no one else in the space.

## Emergency Procedure
Our emergency procedure can be found [here](https://docs.hacman.org.uk/emergency_procedure)

## Negligence
Manchester Hackspace is a place of learning, we will always seek to educate rather than punish. However we have a zero tolerence to willful ignorance of safety.

The decisions you make about how to use our equipment do not just effect you. It could only take one careless incident to shut down our community.

Where members ignore safety concerns or continue using equipment in an unsafe way having been told not to, we may:
* Revoke inducted status requiring you to retrain.
* Ban you from using a tool
* Refer you to our [disciplinary procedure](https://docs.hacman.org.uk/governance/rules/conduct_complaints).
