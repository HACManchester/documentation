# Risk Assesments

All work carried out in Hackspace should be appropriately risk assessed. We maintains risk assessments for all of our tools on our Google Drive. It is your responsibility to familiarise yourself with the risk assessment for each tool you are using before you use it. If you think the risk assessment is insufficient, or incorrect, we would love your contribution.

## Annual Review
Our risk assessments require reviewing annually, and we need help with this. If you have read through a risk assessment and agree it is still valid, please leave a comment on the document with your name and the date at the bottom besides 'last reviewed by'
