# Privacy Policy

The following describes how you can expect Manchester Makers Limited, trading as Manchester Hackspace, to handle your data.

## Membership Data
When you join Manchester Hackspace, we collect, process and store certain personal information for the following reasons:
* Legal Obligation – Your Name and Address are required to be held by us for all members for the government as part of being a Company Limited by Guarantee. We are required to hold this information for ten years after you cease to be a member.
* Contractual – Your Email Address is the method we will use to contact you about company-related information, such as Elections and General Meetings, service updates, or if there is a problem.
* Consent – Your phone number can be used as a backup method to contact you if the directors deem it necessary.
* Vital Interest – Emergency contact details and ‘other information’ are stored to comply with our Health & Safety policy. This information may be passed on to the Emergency Services or a third party at the scene in a situation where you are injured and unable to tell them yourself.
* Legitimate Interest – We store information about rule infractions and complaints about members necessary for enforcing Manchester Hackspace’s rules. We log RFID door openings to the Hackspace for a month after they occur, for security reasons in case of unauthorised entry, and to allow us to debug any issues with the entry system.

## Member Data Deletion
* We will store rule infraction / complaint information for the lifetime of the organisation, as well as enough information to identify a person banned from the Hackspace to prevent them attempting to re-register.
* All personal information will be stored for three years after someone stops being a member, after which everything will automatically be wiped except Name & Address, as we legally have to keep this for 10 years. Former members can request deletion sooner.
* Phone number information can be removed in the members area at any time.
* RFID entry logs are automatically wiped after a month.

## Forum Data
Our forum (https://list.hacman.org.uk) requires a name, email, username, and password. This information is required for basic operation of the forum software. All other personal information is optional and can be removed at any time. Your profile can be set to display first name only.

If posts on our forum contain personal information, this can be removed by request.

## What we won’t do
We won’t use the information that we gather about you to send spam email messages, mail-shots, or similar blanket marketing campaigns. We will not send you special offers or promotions. We will not use any information that we learn about you for advertising, market research or profiling purposes, excepting where that information has been explicitly provided for those purposes.

## Your rights
You may have the right at any time to request access to, rectification or erasure of your personal data; to restrict or object to certain kinds of processing of your personal data; to the portability of your personal data, and to complain to ICO about the processing of your personal data.
