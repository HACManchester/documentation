# Rules of Membership
All members are bound by these rules as a condition of membership. If you have any questions or concerns about your ability to comply with any of the following rules, please email board@hacman.org.uk before completing your membership sign up.

Hackspace Manchester is something we do together. It is a community. The infrastructure (building, equipment, internet etc) provides the foundations, and people working together with shared understandings and expectations are what provide a place of strong community.

Every member is a part of the Hackspace Community and as such must follow the rules and guidelines in place to ensure that the community can exist safely and cohesively.

The following rules lay out the minimum expectations from all Hackspace Members. Examples included in the rules are just that, this is not an exhaustive list of behaviours that may be considered in breach of the rules.

## Rule 1 - Be Excellent to Each Other

Members should treat one another with the respect we feel we deserve ourselves.  
This is an inclusive environment, and we will not tolerate any behaviour that we deem to be harassment, bullying, or discrimination. See our [Conduct Policy](https://docs.hacman.org.uk/governance/rules/conduct_complaints/).

## Rule 2 - Keep Hackspace Tidy

Put tools away, dispose of items appropriately and leave tables tidy.  
Give the floor a sweep from time to time and take out the bins.

## Rule 3 - Respect the Space

Hackspace is a community that provides the facilities, tools and consumables for members to get making. We are not a commodity or service provider.  
Please share the space and tools with others, your needs do not take priority over anyone else's.
Use consumables sparingly, providing your own or replenishing the space’s stock where you are likely to use a lot.  
Where tools get broken, report them via the [report form](https://forms.gle/2cp73P1SHGaGuRvaA) so they can be fixed. 
Our space operates an honesty system for the tuck shop and some material provision.

## Rule 4 - Give Back to the Space

The space is run, maintained and improved by all of us.  
Give back however you can: cleaning, joining a team, upgrading the space, etc.  
See our To-Do list for some ideas. Aim to leave a bit of time spare on every visit to do a few tasks.

## Rule 5 - Do Not Hack or Borrow

Anything labelled do not hack should not be altered or taken apart. Do not mess up another members project.
No tools or items should be taken, borrowed or loaned from the space.  
We do not provide a ‘tool library’ service.

## Rule 6 - Supervise your Guests & Pets

Including under-18s are allowed in the space when accompanied by a member.
Guests must not use induction protected equipment, should be closely supervised and should not disrupt other members.
The member is wholly responsible for the actions of their guests. Any member can request a guest or pet leave if they are causing a nuisance.

Note: The space is full of things that could be hazardous to an animal if ingested or stood on. Please consider this before bringing in your pet.

## Rule 7 - Be Safe

Make sure you are confident you know how to use a tool before using it.
If in doubt ask another member or use the internet. Some tools require a formal induction before you are able to use them.

Wearing personal protective equipment is your responsibility.
Hackspace provides a range of basic PPE.
Please use it and please let the board know if the stock is running low. We foster a culture of safety and learning at Manchester Hackspace.
If you see something unsafe happening, stop the person immediately. If possible create an opportunity for learning and development.

Do not use the food spaces for projects.

## Rule 8 - Be Legal

Follow the rule of UK law when in the space. Alcohol is not permitted when using tools or equipment. Do not use the space to make weapons or controlled substances.

## Rule 9 - Store Your Stuff or Take It Home

The space provides limited storage for active projects.
All items should be stored in either member storage or large project storage and should be clearly labelled with your name, the date and contact details.
If a project becomes inactive please remove it from the space. Do not leave projects in workshop areas.

The Hackspace reserves the right to remove, dispose, donate or repurpose anything not stored inline with these guidelines.
You may be charged for the removal and disposal of abandoned items.

## Rule 10 - Donate Intelligently

Removing ‘donated’ items from the space takes effort away from elsewhere. Consider how useful something is to others before you donate it to the space.  
If in doubt, ask the membership beforehand. Do not leave E-waste in the space.
