# Members Storage Rules
The space provides limited short-term storage for active projects. All stored items should be on a shelf in members storage or in large project storage. When your project is finished or inactive, please free your shelf up for others.

Members may use one cube space, or half of a shelf in the storage area. To claim a shelf:
1. Find an available shelf space.
2. Attach the provided label to your items/the box they're in
3. Add your full name and at least one contact detail (phone number, email, telegram)
4. Renew your label before expiration as required for your storage needs.
5. If your project becomes inactive, take your things home/dispose of them to allow others to use the shelf space.

It is recommended that you store your items in a box to avoid needing to label items individually. Contents must not overhang, overweigh, or otherwise interfere with others’ storage.

Labels provide up to six months of protection (as noted on the label), with new labels released every three months.

Incorrectly stored (e.g. on the floor) and unlabelled items in either of the storage areas will be moved to the ‘Last Chance’ shelves, and may be disposed of or repurposed after one month. Member's should make a reasonable attempt to contact the owner of any expired last chance storage before repurposing it.

Do not leave projects in workshop areas, even if they are labelled.

The Hackspace reserves the right to remove, dispose, donate or repurpose anything not stored inline with these guidelines. 

*Manchester Makers Ltd (t/a Hackspace) take no responsibility for the security of any items stored in the space. We reserve the right to pass on to you any charges incurred for the removal of items incorrectly stored or abandoned at Hackspace, so long as a reasonable attempt has been made to contact you in advance of the charge.*


## Large Projects
Items that cannot fit on a shelf must be stored in the large project storage area, not in members storage. Do not block access to the toilet, sink or door.

Oversized items need to be clearly labelled with a sticker including your name / unique nickname, a method of contacting you and an estimated finish date not further than 1 month in the future. If you are going to overshoot this finish date, update the label.

Do not leave projects in workshop areas, even if they are labelled. Have a back up plan to get your project home if large project storage is full. Unfortunately our space is not suitable for every project. If you need additional storage space [The Northern Group](https://www.northerngroup.co.uk/) and [Pollard Yard](https://www.instagram.com/pollard_yard/) rent storage units upstairs in our building and next door.
