# Consumables

These are items that the hackspace classes as consumables, and aims to keep in stock.
We have a small budget for this so we encourage donations, and have donation jars around the space.

Consumables are sourced and organised by
[Team_Procurement](Team_Procurement "wikilink"). If we're out of something on
this list, please email buythisthing@hacman.org.uk or put it up on the
[Trello Board - things we aint got](https://trello.com/b/7uH9bhEZ/things-we-aint-got).
