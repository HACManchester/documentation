# TheSpacePlan Hacman Manchester!


## Introduction

This is a document to capture the plans for the space, in a concise and easy to understand way.
The purpose of this document is to allow those people who wish to offer their free time, a way to see which things they could help out with.
The best time to update this document would be following any agreed consensus made as a group either in person or via Telegram between members
and/or the Committee of Maintainers for their area of concern.

Just because a plan is recorded here, it doesn't mean it's going to happen and similarly,
changes would continue to happen even if this document didn't exist;
people make change happen and this document should help improve the overall communication and transparency of the space.

The bullet point structure has been chosen since it can be sub-divided many times to allow for more or less granularity as required.
Short term goals should be broken down into self-contained tasks that anyone could follow within reason.
It's appreciated that not everyone will complete a task to the same standard or in the same way.



## Woody Dusty

Leads: Mark (@Marcus6275)

### History

  * 2022-03 - Offcuts lived in 2 piles on the floor either side of the table saw, forming trip hazards and a safety concern.  
    Frank made the first iteration of an offcut storage solution in the location where the lathe is planned to go.

### Short term

  * 2022-07 - Drawers and cupboards are being made by Mark.  
    These will have designations (engraved labels) on the outside but won't be compartmentalised internally - this will be a job for someone else.
    * Plan is to CNC text into the doors/drawer fronts.  
      Some time has been spent already to investigate depth/width of cut, font size, etc.
    * The engraved regions will be filled with blue paint to make the text 'pop'.
  * Evolution Mitre saw requires lifting up slightly to be flush with main work surface.
  * T-rails have been bought to allow clamping of work to the main work surface.  
    These will require 14x6mm slots to be routered in just behind the main working line (formed by the Mitre saw fence and the mortise fence).
  * Kickboards can be added to the cupboards.
  * Dust can fall behind the sanders. This could do with closing off.
  * To prevent dust ingress into cupboards, sealant or caulk could be applied to any gaps on the main work surfaces.

### Medium term

  * Move offcut storage to near the door.
  * Move lathe to where the offcut storage is now.
  * Move the small CNC to where the lathe is now.

### Long term

  * Add fob readers to certain tools to restrict access to only those that have been inducted.
    * Raspberry Pi would authenticate users.
    * Fob readers.
    * Relays.
  * Whole-room shut-off switch by the door.  
    This would trigger a relay in the main consumer unit which would kill power to the whole room. Estimated £600.
  * Could do with a revenue stream to pay for new blades and the general upkeep of the tools.



## Metal/Weldy/Grindy

Leads: Jim Ratcliffe (@Omniatus), Mike (@? Lemon Wipes) and Richard (@Garlicbread)

### History

  * 2022-04 Weldy has seen walls laid, pointed and painted,  
    a door fitted and the room wired.

### Short term

  * Fire strip to be fitted to the door frame by the lift.
  * Extraction is planned to go through the wall that's shared with Visual Arts, at a height of around 3m and travel across to the front wall of the building.
    * Some piping exists. More to be sourced.
    * Fan requires vibration isolation.
    * Fan to be mounted to the wall.
  * Oxygen detector is required to meet the H&S for storing inert gases (in case a bottle leaks, expelling the oxygen from the room and causing surprise asphyxiation).
    * Hard wired into the mains would be best.
    * Appropriate height needs to be considered (or get two oxygen monitors).
  * Training and induction plan needs finishing to include angle grinder and bandsaw training. (Mike H wrote this)
  * Welding bench to be sourced.
  * 4-axis CNC router requires testing and if successful, a suitable home.
    * Richard testing currently.
    * Bob to provide break out board.
  * Furnace requires a decision to keep or not. It requires a door and testing.

### Medium term

### Long term



## Visual arts

Leads:

  * 3D printer - Ella (@smolfluffs) now lives in Sweden but remains the main contact for the 3D printers.
  * Laser cutter - Jason (J @klkl85), Connor (@coneconecone), Bob (@) and Greg (@gregmorris) are good contact points for the laser cutter.

### History

  * The laser cutter uses a certain firmware that requires our current version of Visicut,
    which in turn requires a certain version of OS on the Mac. Please don't update the Mac OS without consulting the laser maintainers.
  * Jason (J) provided the Mac that resides next to the laseprinters. 
    Contact J to install software. Otherwise a restart of the computer wipes all user data.

### Short Term

  * It needs to be much clearer which filaments are available for use with the 3D printers.

### Medium Term

### Long Term

  * Organise 3D printers into a 2x2 or possibly 3x2 grid to maximise the number available in the space currently occupied by the ones we have.
    * Filament storage and delivery to the extruder could be improved.
    * A filament drier could be a good investment. Currently ~£50.
    * A vacuum desiccator could be a good investment. Approx £500. Backing pump already exists in the space.
  * Acquire a second laser cutter.
    This would allow our current laser cutter to be upgraded without fear of breaking the only laser cutter (which sees strong usage currently) and without the time pressure of having the only laser cutter out of action.
    * Where would the second laser cutter live?
    * What size or type would compliment our current one best?
    * How much money has the current laser cutter put into the pot and what does this mean for the budget for the second one?


## SnackSpace / PlantSpace

Lead: Plant watering and lighting - Connor (@coneconecone)  
A relaxing, quiet place to sit.

### History

  * 2022-05 Grayson kindly painted the mural adjacent to the plants.
  * 2022-06 Dish washer is temporarily located by the sink at the back of Large Projects.

### Short Term

### Medium Term

### Long Term

  * Ideally we'd have a kitchenette to house some crockery and cutlery for communal use, the dishwasher, kettle, electric oven/hob, etc.
    * Frank has suggested building a cupboard above the sink that doubles as a drying rack. Thus solving 2 problems with 1 solution, allowing a plate to be washed and put away in the same action. Otherwise we face an endless battle of trying to enforce dried items to be moved off the drying rack and into cupboards.
    * The drain for this area is located behind one of the sofas. For this reason, the alcove between this sofa and the emergency exit door might be the best location for the kitchenette. Drawings should be proposed for review.



## Lab

Lead: Alex (@)

### History

  * The lab doesn't have a waste water drain and for this reason it can't have a mains water feed.
    Instead the lab uses a water fountain for immediate access to water or the sink at the back of large projects is nearby.

### Short Term

  * Safety items such as gloves should be considered if they should be added to the list of consumables.

### Medium Term

### Long Term



## Electronics

Leads: Mark Heywood (@

### Long Term



## General

Leads: No specific, contacting board members is a good start  
Things that affect the whole space or don't fall under a specific area.

### History

  * VAT - We are not VAT registered (companies with turnover greater than £85k must register).
    We don't pay VAT specifically to HMRC, neither do we claim it back.
  * 2022-05 Richard & co painted the ceilings in the main area - these were heavily flaking before

### Short Term

  * 2022-07-07 The shelves in Members Storage have been found to have dangerously sharp edges.
    Protective strip has been identified that looks suitable (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yesland-Universal-Protector-Windows-Protection/dp/B084X4XFCY/)
    * Order 1 roll of 20m protective strip.
    * Test the strip to see it's fit for purpose.
      * If testing successful, order enough strip to cover the total edging, estimated to be ~140m.
      * If testing not successful, source better strip.

  * Front door access - Mark (Lemon) and Cone are implementing improvements to the system.
    * Crash bars will be added to the doors to aid in an emergency exit.
    * Fob reader will be moved off the door and onto the wall, thereby removing the trailing cables on the inside.

### Medium Term

  * Second set of double doors - implement 2nd stage authorised access to remove the single point failure of the front door accidentally being left open.
    * Add fob reader access.
    * Add keypad access (for those using the loo and forgetting their fob)
      * Suggested codes include 766766 (poopoo), 2727 (crap).

### Long Term

  * Set up projector and screen. This could be used for Members Meetings, movie nights, etc.
