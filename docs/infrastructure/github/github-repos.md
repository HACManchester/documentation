    It's also for containing information about networking / firewalls / network diagrams etc  

## Tools

  * https://github.com/HACManchester/Tools.Ender6.Klipper

  * https://github.com/HACManchester/Tools.ProxxonCNC  
    One of the devices we still have in electronics is a tniy Proxon CNC, (originally the first we had)
    Needs a bit of setup to get it working properly but this is the docs related to that
    We still have it so keep this one around

## Projects

  * https://github.com/HACManchester/CogClock  
    This was originally a project of Bob's for a very large laser cut clock that mounts on the wall  
    It's still around hanging on the wall of the Hackspace  
    It's one issue is that the stepper motors are not strong enough to move the rings

  * https://github.com/HACManchester/Foundary.ElectricCoil  
    Details for a future project for building a Electric Coil Foundary for casting or hardening metal

  * https://github.com/HACManchester/docker-dokuwiki
    https://github.com/HACManchester/dokuwiki-demo-setup  
    This was a dokuwiki demo setup I did that uses markdown instead of the dokuwiki syntax
    If we could get a standard setup for the hacman authentication
    then this could be a good replacment for the existing docs setup
