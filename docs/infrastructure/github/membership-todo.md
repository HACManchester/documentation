# MemberShip / Door Access - Todo

This is a list of repositories assocaited ether with the membership system or door access.
Ideally we need to review the below to see what is needed

## Membership system

Not sure of the status of these
some of this we might need but at the very least could do with being condensed down to less repos

  * https://github.com/HACManchester/membership-system
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/membership-deployment
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/BBMembershipSystem
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/membersystembeta
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/MCP-LDAP  
    I think this was an attempt at LDAP on an old version of the site
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/hacman_down  
    Some sort of placeholder if the main site is down?
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/MCP
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/nginx-proxy  
    Used by Zerocool
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/Hackspace-Ansible
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/hackiosk
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/redash-deployment
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/docker-compose-lamp
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/snackscreen

### Email / Discourse Related

  * https://github.com/HACManchester/Apps.Discourse  
    This is some notes associated with the setup of the original mailing list.  
    However ideally it needs updates from whoever is maintaining the mailing list at the moment.
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/mta-sts.hacman.org.uk  
    This repos is needed for the mta-sts feature of the mailing list, it needs to remain seperate
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/Cloud-Forum2Telegram  
    This posts notification to telegram on new mailing list post

## Door System / Card Access

These relate to the door access system, we have two different systems setup currently  
The old system Ben setup which is acting as a backup, sensor mounted directly to the door (I think Alfie).  
The new system mounted to the wall which can take pin numbers or rfid tags

  * https://github.com/HACManchester/FRED
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/door-alarm
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/haccess-code
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/ALF
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/HacmanDoorSwitches  
    Door Bell system I think
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/mqtt2telegram  
    Might be the scripts for the hacman bot channel on telegram
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/mqtt-2-sound  
    thing which makes a sound on door entry - linked to the newer door system I think
  * https://github.com/HACManchester/beacon  
    We used to have a large rotating beacon on top of the door I think to indicate the door bell had been pushed

Ideally we could do with merging all this into two repos one for the old and one for the new door system
