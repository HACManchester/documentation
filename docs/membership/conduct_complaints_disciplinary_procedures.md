# Conduct, Complaints, Aand Disciplinary Procedures

## CONDUCT POLICY
Manchester Hackspace is proud of its diverse community from all walks of life and with all sorts of skills. Anyone who follows our [rules](https://www.hacman.org.uk/rules/) is welcome to use the space in harmony regardless of sex, gender, ethnicity, race, ability, sexuality, socio-economic background or belief. We will not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment includes, but may not be limited to:

* Offensive comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, or socio-economic background.
* Deliberate intimidation.
* Stalking or following.
* Inappropriate or unwanted physical contact.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Inappropriate or unrequested photography or recording.
* Sustained or repeated disruption.
* Lack of respect for personal space.

We expect anyone asked to stop something to do so immediately.

If you act or talk in a way that someone thinks is inappropriate, it is inappropriate. Do not ever put your opinions or desires before the comfort of others. There is never an excuse for behaviour that makes anyone else feel unwelcome or targeted.

Where a member or their guest is found to be breaking the rules or disrupting the peace, you should try to communicate this with them as the first port of call if it is safe to do so. Hackspace functions best when it's a safe environment for us to learn from one another.

## FORMAL COMPLAINTS

If the behaviour continues or the member does not feel comfortable this should be reported via the [Complaints Form](https://forms.gle/HC2xJrz1XcXx4W1w7). This can be filled in by someone else on your behalf and can only be seen by the board of directors. We would never discourage a formal complaint as being too small, as often it helps to build a case of evidence of someone's character that can aid future decisions.

The form asks for the following compulsory information:
* Reporter Name
* Reporter Email
* Identifying information (name/nickname/description) of the person
* The time, date and location of the incident
* Description of the incident
* The frequency of incidents of this type
* Other people involved in the incident/witnesses
* Restriction of access and termination of membership

If the behaviour was online, screenshots of a conversation are often useful.

The directors will only take action on formal complaints, not hearsay.

If your complaint is about a board member, please speak to another board member directly.

## DISCIPLINARY PROCESS

When a formal complaint is received, a minimum of two directors will review the complaint. All complaints are logged and given a case number. The reviewers will make a decision whether to take the complaint further, taking into consideration (but not being guided by) the wishes of the reporter. The reviewers will attempt to verify the complaint, check if other reports have been submitted about the member, and review the complaint against our [rules](https://www.hacman.org.uk/rules/) before making a final decision. We will try to complete this process within six weeks wherever possible.

Decisions are usually:
* Log the complaint with no further action
* Send a pre-warning email to the member reminding them of our rules
* Issue a formal warning
* Temporary suspension of membership
* Permanent suspension of membership

The board of directors reserve the right to restrict or terminate membership of the Hackspace for whatever reasons they deem sufficient, including during the investigation of a complaint. No compensation nor refund will be given. Here are some general guidelines as to behaviour likely to cause restriction or termination of membership:

* receiving three or more warnings from within 12 months
* continuing with a pattern of behaviour after you have been asked to stop.
* a pattern of harassing behaviour, whether or not warnings have been issued.
* a single serious or obviously intentional offence.

Where a complaint is either about a director or submitted by a director, the complaint will be reviewed by uninvolved directors. In the exceptional case where it is not believed two directors can review the case impartially, a trusted member may be asked to assist with the review.

Where cases are discussed in board meetings, they will be referred to by case number. No identifying personal information will be minuted about the reporter nor reportee. Our disciplinary process is always carried out inline with our [privacy policy](https://hacman.org.uk/privacy-policy/).
