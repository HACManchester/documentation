# Buying Things
The following outlines the Hackspace procurement system through which any member can buy things to improve the space.

The system is divided into two separate systems:
1. Purchase Proposals - any item which is not covered by the consumables list. This could include deviations from a consumable, infrastructure projects, or buying equipment.
2. Consumables - Items which are expected to be replaced frequently. This includes blades, paper products, electronics components, cleaning equipment, oils, adhesives, etc.

# Purchase Proposals
For any purchases not covered by the consumables list (see below), a purchase proposal is required. Purchase proposals can only be put forward by any active member.

A purchase proposal should consist of the following:
* A clearly defined aim, including who it will affect and how.
* State any resources required and who will undertake any work needed.
* Name/description of each item
* Include a budget, this may include:
    * Itemised cost
    * Number of units
    * Total cost of proposal
    * On-going consumables
* Link to purchases

Some other considerations you may wish to discuss:
* Where will it be stored/installed?
* If this replaces existing equipment, what will happen to the old?
* Risk assessments
* Inductions process if required
* How will it be funded? Fully funded, part funded, crowd funded, etc.

Proposal development discussion should take place on a separate thread to the final proposal. Once a member has developed a proposal it should be written up onto the forum under the [“Purchase Proposals” category](https://list.hacman.org.uk/c/41/l/latest). A proposal should not materially change once raised, or in response to comments; if a proposal needs to be amended, please close the proposal and create a new one.

## Membership Approval
Purchase proposals require general member support and board member approval before they are formally approved for purchase. Levels of support required are grouped by price, see ‘Proposal Bands’ below. Using the forum helps us keep a record of purchases, along with the intent, and discussion around why this particular item was purchased.

After approval, all purchases should be made within 90 days unless otherwise agreed. After this time, the proposal must be run again.

Members can show their support for the proposal on the final thread by commenting affirmatively (e.g. “+1”, “I support this proposal!”).

Board members will fulfil a procedural role in ensuring the proposal is aligned with the aims & ambitions of the Hackspace, and the Hackspace is in a position to accept the proposal. They will comment affirmatively that they are lending board approval (e.g. “+1 board”). Board members will review proposals by considering at least the following:
* Health and safety/risk assessments
* Financial viability
* Compliance with legal duties
* Effects on membership
* Impact on the physical space.

Board members may choose to lend their support to a proposal as a general member as well as lend their procedural approval as a board member, although doing both will generally be avoided to minimise conflicts of interest.

## Proposal bands
Purchase proposals are grouped by price, with each band having a different number of independent supporting members/board members to be approved.
* Micro Proposal <£50 - 2 general members and 1 board member
* Small Proposal < £150 - 5 general members and 2 board members
* Medium Proposal < £500 - 10 general members and strict majority of board members
* Large Proposal > £500 - Large proposals can only be approved at members meetings with majority support from the members present. Proxy votes can be used. Majority board support is required for the proposal to pass.
## Reimbursement
Fill in this [Google form](https://forms.gle/NAwY9UQmAdEzJJzQ7), providing your proof of purchase and expect repayment within 30 days. In circumstances where the member does not have sufficient funds to make the purchase themselves, they should make a request for purchase via board@hacman.org.uk.


# Consumables
The hackspace maintains one central list of consumables which can be found at the link below. Members can replenish the hackspace with these pre-approved items. It is recommended members double check the existing stock is definitely depleted via telegram first. Note some items are restricted to area coordinators or board purchases only.

Any item can apply to become a consumable with the support of the board OR by a majority vote at any members meeting. Items can be later withdrawn from the list by majority vote at members meeting or by the board at their own discretion; this must be recorded in the published minutes or in a forum post with a stated reason for removal.
