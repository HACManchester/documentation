# Hack the Space Days 

These are organised days where we get together to improve the space. 

Lately these have become clean the space days and we need to get away from that. They should be about doing work to improve the space this could be from creating new tool storage to adding a wall.

Anyone is free to organise one just post on the forum and telegram
