# Complaints Policy

If the behaviour continues or the member does not feel comfortable this should be reported via the [Complaints Form](https://forms.gle/HC2xJrz1XcXx4W1w7) as soon as practical.
This can only be seen by the board of directors. If your complaint is about a board member, please speak to another board member directly.

The form asks for the following compulsory information:

  * Reporter Name
  * Reporter Email
  * Identifying information (name/nickname/description) of the person
  * The time, date and location of the incident
  * Description of the incident
  * The frequency of incidents of this type
  * Other people involved in the incident/witnesses

## Restriction of access and termination of membership

The board of directors reserve the right to restrict or terminate membership of the Hackspace for whatever reasons they deem sufficient.
However, here are some general guidelines as to behaviour likely to cause restriction or termination of membership:

  * receiving three or more warnings from within 6 months
  * continuing with behaviour after you have been asked to stop.
  * a pattern of harassing behaviour, whether or not warnings have been issued.
  * a single serious or obviously intentional offence.

The board reserves the right to suspend access to the Hackspace while investigations are carried out. No compensation nor refund will be given in this case, or in the case of membership termination.
