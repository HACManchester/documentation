# Conduct Policy

Manchester Hackspace is proud of its diverse community from all walks of life and with all sorts of skills.
Everyone is welcome to use the space in harmony regardless of sex, gender, ethnicity, race, ability, sexuality, socio-economic background or belief.

We will not tolerate harassment in any form. Harassment includes, but may not be limited to:

  * Offensive comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, religion, or socio-economic background.
  * Deliberate intimidation.
  * Stalking or following.
  * Inappropriate or unwanted physical contact.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention.
  * Inappropriate or unrequested photography or recording.
  * Sustained or repeated disruption.
  * Lack of respect for personal space.
  * Any other action that makes someone uncomfortable.

We expect anyone asked to stop to do so immediately.

If you act or talk in a way that someone thinks is inappropriate, it is inappropriate.
Do not ever put your opinions or desires before the comfort of others. There is never an excuse for behaviour that makes anyone else feel unwelcome or targeted.

Where a member or their guest is found to be breaking the rules or disrupting the peace, you should let them know as the first port of call.
