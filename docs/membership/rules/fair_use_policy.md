# Fair Use Policy

Together we provide a space that is available 24 hours a day, where members can design, make, learn, share and socialise, and we think we do this at a very fair price.  
Hackspace runs on a very slim yearly budget to keep our membership costs as low as possible. 
By joining as a member of the space, you are paying subscription to a community. Please do not treat the space as a commodity.
Sometimes tools will be broken, and we recognise this can be frustrating when a project needs finishing,
but it is all of our responsibility to make sure our tools are kept in good condition, and consumables are kept in stock.
You’re welcome to use the hackspace as much as you like on the basis:

  * Your use of the space is within the remit of Hackspace’s aims.
  * You don’t monopolise the space or equipment to the detriment of other members.
  * You don’t live at hackspace

Our membership fees are upwards scalable from the minimum amount based on the usage you get from the space.
If your business makes use of the space, consider donating a proportion of your profits back to the space.

Hackspace provides a basic range of consumables to help projects.
Use them sparingly, providing your own or replenishing the space’s stock where you are likely to use a lot.
If a consumable is running low, have a look if it is on the consumables list, and if you are able to replenish it, or let someone know it is running low.

Remember this is a shared space, so don’t treat it like your home. This means:

  * Hackspace is not your bedroom. Power naps are fine. All-night hacking sessions are fine. Intentionally sleeping the night is not.
  * Hackspace is not your kitchen. Our small kitchenette is for making tea and snacks, not for cooking three full meals a day.
  * Hackspace is not your shed. We have limited storage, which is in high demand. Ensure your possessions left at the space comply with our Member’s Storage Guidelines.
  * We don’t employ any staff, so to keep Hackspace running smoothly we rely on all members giving a little of their time in proportion to the use they get out of the space.

When you visit, try to set aside 10-15 minutes before you leave to do some of the quick tasks that keep the space safe and usable for everyone. These include:

  * Taking out the bins
  * Sweeping the floors
  * Emptying bins and vacuum cleaners
  * Refilling soap dispensers
  * Restocking the tuckshop fridge & consumables
  * Giving tours at our open evenings
  * Taking on a task from the to-do list
  * Maintaining tools, and reporting faulty ones via the [report form](https://forms.gle/2cp73P1SHGaGuRvaA) 
  * Taking things to the tip.

If you’re a more frequent user, please also consider offering to help with bigger or more regular jobs. These include:

  * Machine inductions
  * Open evening tours
  * Administration
  * Organising skill-shares and events
  * Attending Hack-the-Space Days
  * Joining a subgroup team
  * Becoming a Director

# Commercial Use of Hackspace

Using the space for business purposes (such as prototyping your start-up’s products) is fine,
but remember that your business is no more important than any other member’s project.
You do not get priority access to equipment, storage, or workspaces. You can’t expect other members to stay out of your way, stay quiet, or give up their turn on equipment.

Do not use Hackspace as your business’ registered address.
