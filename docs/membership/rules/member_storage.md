# Members Storage Guidelines
The space provides limited storage for active projects. All stored items should be in either member storage or large project storage. When your project finishes, please free your shelf up for others.

Members may use one cube space, or half of a shelf in the storage area. To claim a shelf:
1. Find an available shelf.
2. Attach a label to your items/the box they're in
3. Add your full name and at least one contact detail (phone number (preferable), email, telegram)
4. Renew your label as required for your storage needs.
5. If your project becomes inactive, take your things home/dispose of them to allow others to use the shelf.

It is recommended that you store your items in a box to avoid needing to label items individually. Contents must not overhang, overweigh, or otherwise interfere with others’ storage.

Labels provide up to six months of protection (as noted on the label), with new labels released every three months.

Unlabelled items in either of the storage areas will be moved to the ‘Last Chance’ shelves, and may be disposed of or repurposed after one month. Do not leave projects in workshop areas, even if they are labelled.

The Hackspace reserves the right to remove, dispose, donate or repurpose anything not stored inline with these guidelines. 

Though hackspace is full of pleasant folk, we take no responsibility for the security of any items stored in the space.


## Large Projects
If you’re going to take up a lot of space with a project you must ask on the forum for general permission to store your items.

Oversized items must be stored in the large project storage area, not in members storage.

Oversized items need to be clearly labelled with a Do Not Hack sticker including your name / unique nickname, a method of contacting you and an estimated finish date. If you are going to overshoot this finish date, replace the Do Not Hack sticker with an updated estimate.

Do not leave projects in workshop areas, even if they are labelled.
