# Teams
Teams are ‘active maintainers of the area.’ ie. Somebody who has maintained equipment and
tidied/organised the area within the last 3 months (or in the case of a digital area, the
equivalent), and have communicated that work either via team comms or the forum.

Any member of a team can add a qualifying member to a team. If you are
constantly helping out and improving an area, the team should not block you becoming a
part of it.

The following are guidelines for how team meetings can run. Teams can adapt these guidelines to best suit their area. The area coordinator will coordinate this and ensure things runs smoothly.

At each team meeting (which will be open to members), the team will:
- discuss and remove inactive members of the team
- discuss consumable and other required purchases
- discuss other ideas and planning for the area
- discuss training with the trainers

Trainers do not have to be part of the team.

The board can add and remove members from teams.
