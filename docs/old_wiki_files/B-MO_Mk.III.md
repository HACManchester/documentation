B-MO Mk.III is a new version in my B-MO Project based off the [B-MO
Mk.II](B-MO_Mk.II "wikilink") version, with a variety of upgrades and
new features. The iPad used in Mk.II has been removed and a 7" TFT LCD
screen has replaced it. In combination with a Raspberry Pi and a number
of Teensy 2.0 microcontrollers, input can be taken from the buttons on
the front of B-MO and run actions to show on the display (eg. pressing
the green button will make B-MO say a positive response, while the red
button will provide a negative response). In addition to this, two
TowerPro SG90 servos will be used to move the arms on each side of B-MO,
giving 90° movement up and down when an action is given. The USB ports
at the front allow for controllers to be plugged in and send inputs to
the Raspberry Pi, such as directional inputs for playing a game. The
Rasbperry Pi camera module will be connected to the Raspberry Pi and can
take photographs on an action which is then saved to the internal
storage for later uploading.
