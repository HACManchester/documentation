Use
---

### Materials

-   If it sticks to a magnet it is fine.
-   If it is stainless steel (and you are sure) it is fine.
-   Otherwise check first.

### Before Use

-   Ensure that the wheels are free from defects and have no aluminium
    embedded in them. They should be dull, not shiny.
-   Ensure that the rests are near but not touching the wheels.
-   Ensure that the guards are down - adjust them from the hinge not the
    loose end.
-   Ensure the wheels rotate freely before switching the grinder on by
    turning them by hand.
-   When adjusting the clear guards, make sure to adjust the left-hand
    by grabbing the top of the guard. It has snapped off in the past and
    been reattached using epoxy.

### Using the grinder

-   Do not grip the work too close to the wheel - it gets hot
-   Do not force the work too hard - the grinder relies on speed, not on
    power
-   When smoothing the end of a rod, steady it with the hand closest to
    the grinder and turn and rotate it with the other.

Safety
------

-   Wear eye protection - hot metal in the eye is not pleasant
-   Do **NOT** wear gloves - they could get entangled and pull your hand
    into the machine
-   Never use the side of the wheel, however convenient it may seem.
    This can cause the wheel to shatter
-   Don't stand in the path of the wheel when starting the grinder in
    case a wheel should shatter
-   Don't leave the grinder until it has completely stopped spinning -
    other members may not realise it is still dangerous
