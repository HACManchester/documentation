Woo, EMFCamp is happening again!

Blurb
-----

Electromagnetic Field is a UK camping festival for those with an
inquisitive mind or an interest in making things: hackers, artists,
geeks, crafters, scientists, and engineers.

This summer we're gathering over a thousand people in a field for a
weekend of talks and workshops.

At previous events we've heard about everything from genetic
modification to electronics, blacksmithing to high-energy physics,
reverse engineering to lock picking, computer security to crocheting,
and quadcopters to beer brewing.

To help matters along, we're arranging a very fast internet connection,
reliable WiFi, a bar stocked with good, reasonably-priced drinks, and
much more.
