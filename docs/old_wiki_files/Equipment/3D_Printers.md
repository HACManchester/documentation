We have two 3D printers for use within the hackspace:

-   [Mendel90](Mendel90 "wikilink") - This is the general usage 3D
    printer. Its reliable, needs minimal maintenance, and will print PLA
    or ABS. If you're just starting out, you want to use this printer.
-   [MendelMax](MendelMax "wikilink") - This printer is a bit more
    finicky, and recommended for advanced users only.
