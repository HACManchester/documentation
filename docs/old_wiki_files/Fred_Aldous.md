Fred aldous is a local arts, crafts, and materials shop in the Northern
Quarter of Manchester. They stock a wide range of materials, including
laser safe plywood and MDF, acrylic sheet, card, paints, casting
materials, and much more.

While their cost is slightly higher than many other places, the student
discount, lack of P&P, and the lack of delivery time has made them
fairly popular for members who want something \*\*now\*\*.

They also have a rentable laser and photo studio.
