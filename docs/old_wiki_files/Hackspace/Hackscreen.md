Hackscreen is what is shown on the TVs
--------------------------------------

![](Metrolinkscreen.png "fig:Metrolinkscreen.png") Hackscreen is a
webapp that shows useful content to users. The TVs do not have signal at
all, and shouldn't be used as such unless a TV license is bought.
Instead of being turned off Cone made a webapp that cycles through
content.
