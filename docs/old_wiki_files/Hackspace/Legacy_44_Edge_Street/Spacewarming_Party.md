After careful consideration, crossing out weekends for moving in,
makerfaires and camping, we have a date for the new Hackspace Manchester
spacewarming party!

On the 22nd and 23rd of September, weâ€™ll be open from 11:59am until
11:00pm.

<onlyinclude>Come along, solder things, chop up things, drink things,
eat things and make things!</onlyinclude>
