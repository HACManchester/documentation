Risk assessments are a frequent requirement for events and for insurance
purposes - when you complete a risk assessment, please use this data, or
update it if needed (if there is a new piece of equipment for example).

Events Risk Assessments
-----------------------

Here are some example risk assessments done for items within the
hackspace. These could be useful for Maker events, public events, or
even when hiring out equipment.
