Derusting with Electrolysis
---------------------------

### Overview

-   <http://www.robotroom.com/Rust-Removal-2.html>

In order to derust a part we can use Electrolysis to remove the rust
from a metal part
The below setup includes

-   4 nails around the outside dangling down, wired to the positive of
    the supply
-   A single wire dangling down on the middle connected to the part to
    de-rust

#### Power Supply

Ideally the power supply needs to be approx 12V with as many amps as
possible The one in the picture is a spare originally belonging to Tas /
Skippy for charging a battery. This seems to work very well over a short
period of time

#### Water mixture

The main ingredient other than water is Bicarbonate of Soda. Note Baking
Powder should be avoided since it has other things in which interfere
with the process.

-   6 Litres of water = 40ml of Bicarbonate of Soda
-   5 gallons of water = 1/2 cup of Bicarbonate of Soda
-   2 gallons of water = approx 1/4 cup of Bicarbonate of Soda

### Cleaning the black Coating

After using Electrolysis to remove rust from a part sometimes there will
be a black coating left over. This can be avoided by using de-ionised
water, although another way around this is to use a mixture of

-   Water
-   Toothpaste
-   Baking Soda
