The weekend of 25th - 26th April 2015 is the UK Maker Faire, held at the
[Centre for
Life](https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?ie=UTF-8&q=centre+for+life+newcastle&fb=1&gl=uk&hq=centre+for+life+newcastle&hnear=centre+for+life+newcastle&cid=0,0,1504349654150948153&ei=bsVYUf-9EYic0AXez4GIBg&ved=0CJcBEPwSMAA)
in Newcastle.

There will be a HacMan table you can volunteer at. Unless you are
volunteering, you will need to [buy a
ticket](http://www.life.org.uk/ticket/redirect.php?id=218&type=events&email=true).

Many people choose to go up on Friday and come back on Monday.

Any questions, shout [Chris](User:badspyro "wikilink")

Coach takes a while, with Mega Bus dropping off outside the train
