What needs doing?

Before pack the space day
=========================

-   If possible, all personal belongings / boxes should be removed from
    the space. This decreases the amount of stuff we need to move, and
    decreases the possibility of something getting lost along the way.
-   <s>The acrylic boxes in the entryway need breaking down into sheets
    suitable for the laser cutter. Bob has some circular saw dremel bits
    which should work nicely for this.</s> *Done 19th March - Bob*
-   <s>Collect cardboard boxes for packing.</s> *Done 17th March -
    Kimball & Steph have lent us about 40 moving boxes*
-   Remove boxes of e-waste and bags of rubbish from the space.

On the day
==========

-   pack as much rarely used equipment as possible into boxes, label and
    prepare for moving.
-   disconnect units of great wall of storage
-   Remove internal RFID reader and fill hole
-   Remove geocache sticker
