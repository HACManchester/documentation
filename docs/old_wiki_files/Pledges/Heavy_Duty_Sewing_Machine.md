### Heavy Duty Sewing Machine

The sewing machine we have, while now functioning, as a non-branded
model with no parts support, a relatively light-weight motor, and no
features to speak of other than a handful of stitches. It's also more
difficult than most to put the bobbin in the under-side.

I therefore suggest we look at getting a more robust model that has more
features, a good warranty, ease of use, and can sew through thicker
material.

I suggest a Heavy Duty Singer machine, which the manuals state have many
of these features - the 4432 seems to be the best, having a higher
number of stitches for a similar price to the 4423, however it would
need to be imported from Europe. This still, however, puts it at a lower
price than the 4423 from UK stockists.

We should be able to pick one up, new, on ebay for around £210-£220 from
Europe (Germany or Italy by the looks of things) meaning that we
shouldn't have to pay any import duties. Which is nice. However we will
need to grab an EU-UK converter in the immediate future, and later a
replacement cable and foot control.
