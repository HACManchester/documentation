So, a fantastic vacuum former has been discovered on ebay, and since
it's been on quite a few people's wish lists for a long time, we're
running a pledge drive!

The former is a [Formech](http://formech.com/) Compac 343, and has bed
dimensions of 16 7/8" x 16 7/8" x 7 7/8". The company that manufactures
them appears to be a major brand, and this former seems a reasonable
size for the hackspace and the projects members might want to use it
for.

The sticking points are that this is an auction, so we're not sure what
price we're going to be able to get the shiny equipment for. The good
thing is, one of our gorgeous members has offered to pick it up as it's
buyer collect - meaning that we should be able to get it at a decent
price as it's in deepest, darkest, Scotland.
