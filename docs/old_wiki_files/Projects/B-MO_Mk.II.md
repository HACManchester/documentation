B-MO Mk.II is a completed version of my B-MO Project based off the [B-MO
Mk.I](B-MO_Mk.I "wikilink") prototype to hold an iPad 3 inside it's body
and act as a screen. The iPad uses a video looping app to loop a video
of B-MO's face, blinking and talking to the viewer. The iPad slides in
and out of the body from the top, allowing for removal for charging or
other usage. Audio is output using two X-Mi X Mini II speakers
daisy-chained together to boost the volume in crowded areas.

Features
--------

-   Animated face
-   Audio speech (based on pre-recorded lines)
-   Manual moving arms
