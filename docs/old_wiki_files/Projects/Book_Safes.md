Project Aim
-----------

When I was a kid, spycraft was unbearably cool. One of the things I
always wanted to make was a hollowed out book to keep secret stuff in.

### Choosing A Book

One of the most important tasks is choosing the correct book.

The book must be large enough to contain whatever you want to hide.
Also, it must be a book which would not look out of place on your
bookshelves, but preferable be a bit dull, so people won't pick it up.

Oh, and always go for a hard-back.

Software
--------

-   None. This is a hardware hack.
