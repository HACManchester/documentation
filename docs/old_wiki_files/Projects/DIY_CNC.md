<onlyinclude>**Current Status** - Working out
specifications.</onlyinclude>

So, we want to make a machine for 3d printing, cnc drilling, pcb
routing... They have a common starting point, an X-Y gantry.

First thing we need to decide is what size we should make it.

My thoughts, for a first testbed, are to make something fairly small,
bed size of about 200mm x 200mm. This can then be driven from a few
stepper motors (we have some lying about from murdered printers), using
either a belt drive or threaded rod
([1](http://www.screwfix.com/prods/72061/) would be perfect).

Once we have this running, we can use a dremel for the router bit, and
have a working small CNC machine, that can be used for PCBs and making
small parts from foam and wood. I'm looking at
[2](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-a-Three-Axis-CNC-Machine-Cheaply-and-/)
for guidance, which is an instructable written by oomlout, seems like
it'd be a good place to start.
