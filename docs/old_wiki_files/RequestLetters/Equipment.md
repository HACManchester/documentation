Request Letter for asking for discounts on new kit
--------------------------------------------------

An idea is to use something like this when asking for discounts or
freebies from companies

### Letter Content

Hi **<XXXX>**

I represent Manchester Hackspace, a community 'Makerspace' or
'Hackerspace' which essentially functions like a shared community
workshop/workspace allowing people who lack the space to make things, or
don't have the tools at home, can come along, join our community and
share our tools. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace>.

We're currently interested in purchasing a new **<XXXX>**.
I was wondering if it would be possible to source any discounts in
relation to the above.

We started as a small group of members located within the Stockport
area, but have grown rapidly and are now located within the central area
of Manchester. <https://hacman.org.uk/> with approx 70 members. In the
future we are planning to move to a larger area some time next year.

**Governance**
**&lt;TODO Change this to blarrb associated with Manchester, we are not
a CIC&gt;
** We are a registered UK Community Interest Company, meaning that all
donations are immediately 'locked' in Trust for the community served,
and cannot be sold/stripped out of the company. We have 4 directors and
an advisory board which includes member of the Leigh Spinners Mill
Redevelopment Team and are decisions are made democratically by our
65-person strong community. We are non-profit and all time is
voluntarily donated.

**What We Need:**
We are approaching a range of enterprises such as yourselves, to ask for
support for our important community. There are a variety of ways that
organisations can contribute, depending on their size, financial
resources, and degree to which they would like to be involved: Donations
of small tools, fixings, materials, storage equipment, PPE, unsorted
items, etc for members' use. (list available on request of what kind of
things we would need) Reciprocal arrangements such as a 'Hackspace
Member's Discount' in return for some brand advertising and our
gratitude.
Financial donations of any size are also welcome!

**What You Get:**
**&lt;TODO Check we can do the below, roles responsibilities etc&gt;**
Apart from the satisfaction of helping our tiny grassroots organisation
to develop, you are helping fellow makers. We will show our gratitude by
ensuring **<XXXX>** are credited on our Facebook Group and Twitter
account, mentioned in Local press when the Hackspace is featured, and we
can also display your branding on our Supporter's Wall in the shop,
along with details of the donation.

Many thanks,
Bob the builder
Director & Founder & keeper of the laser keys
