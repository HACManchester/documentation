Welcome to the home of the Crafty Crew, responsible for looking after,
maintaining, and growing the [Craftspace](Craftspace "wikilink"), as
well as training people up on our equipment!

We're interested in all kinds of crafts, and love growing the equipment
and consumables we have to allow the members to learn new skills, try
out new toys, and make cool projects.

If you want to see what we're upto, feel free to take a look at our

Equipment
---------

For sewing, we have two [Sewing Machines](Sewing_Machines "wikilink")
and an [Overlocker](Overlocker "wikilink") that both require training
before use by members, and our member Ada Lovelace, the Dressmaker's
Dummy - as well as the standard sewing kit and some embroidery hoops. We
have brushes, a smattering of paints, some modeling and carving kit, and
even some glass painting and leading bits laying about. We're working to
expand this, and are looking at acquiring a few pieces of equipment...

Equipment Wanted

This is part of the main hackspace [Tools
Wishlist](Tools_Wishlist "wikilink"), and contains a brief outline of
the tool, the potential cost, and the members who are interested in
acquiring and using it.

Craft Area Consumables
----------------------

These are items that the hackspace classes as consumables, and we and
Team Purchasing aim to keep in stock for our area. We have a small
budget for this so we encourage donations, and have donation jars around
the space.
