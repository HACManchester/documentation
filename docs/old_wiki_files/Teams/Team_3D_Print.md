This team maintains and trains people in the use of the 3D printers in
the space.

Equipment/Projects
------------------

The space has 2 printers - they are the [Mendel90](Mendel90 "wikilink")
and the [MendelMax](MendelMax "wikilink").

Equipment Wanted
----------------

-   A resin printer
-   Any donations of 3/2.85 mm filament for the space stock are welcome

Consumables
-----------

Filament is supplied by members - the space keeps a small supply from
donations for demonstrations and space projects.

We've found [3DFilaPrint](http://shop.3dfilaprint.com/) to both supply
good material and also be fairly good price wise.

People
------

The following people are members of the team, and can deliver training
