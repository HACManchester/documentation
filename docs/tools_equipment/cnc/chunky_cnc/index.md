Welcome to the new Manchester Hackspace PrintNC wiki.

The machine is named **Little Chunky.**

Chunky has been built from scratch in the Hackspace and on loan from the member who built it. It is largely based on the open source project PrintNC v4, though with some modifications. The PrintNC is successfully used in industry and commercially, and is a modern and currently maintained open source project.

Chunky is so named due to the small work area of 600x450 (actually 500, but the last 50 is reserved for ATC and toolsetting) and the rigid specifications specifically designed by the owner for excellent drilling and boring.

Chunky is able to cut all sorts of plastics and wood, aluminium and other soft metals, as well as mild steel, stainless and tool steel with the correct experience and patience. It will be available soon for member use and features the following specifications:

- Based on the open source Print NC project
- Around 500kg in total.
- ER20 water cooled spindle with ceramic bearings
- Capable of 20k mm/min rapids, and 15k feed cutting soft woods
- Cuts wood at 16k mm/min with 45mm step down if you want some terrible tearout
- Controller is the excellent FlexiHal by Expatria technologies
 - GRBLHAL software interfaced through a sender.
 - Real time control and jog controller with DRO.
 -    Semi automatic tool changing, 3d probing, and tool setting.
 -    Fully enclosed, with 3 cameras for monitoring, including a spindle camera
 -    Vacuum, air lines, and advanced MQL system for metals
 -    Over 500 holes tapped during construction
  -   Self designed ATC and vacuum vices in progress Plans for a 4th (lathe) axis. Super Adept lathe purchased for this
    -    Holds accuracy to approximately 0.05mm

For getting started with Chunky you'll need to learn some CAD and CAM skills, both of which is recommended to be done in Autodesk Fusion360. You will also need the GRBLHAL postprocessor from Dietz. Tools will be available in the space, both basic (free induction tooling) and advanced (available to purchase at fair prices.)

The pages in this folder should help you get the requisite information to prepare for induction and machining.
