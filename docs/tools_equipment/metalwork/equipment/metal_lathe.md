# Metal Lathe

We have three metal lathes at the Hackspace
- Myford ML7
- Warco 220
- Atlas Halifax

## Ownership

The Warco 220 currently belongs to Michael / MuteDuck

The Myford ML 7 is on loan on a (hopefully) permanent basis from Steve.
As such, treat the machine with respect and do not abuse/mistreat it.

The Atlas Halifax lathe is currently in the middle of being reninvated / converted to a cnc lathe.
It belongs to Richard / Garlicbread

## About

The Myford ML 7 lathe was manufactured in the 1940's as a light
machining and model lathe. The lathe has the space to take a roughly 5"
diameter by 20" length piece of work (*double check actual sizes*).

This machine is ONLY for metalwork, and should only be used by people
who have been trained.

## Usage

  - When first starting to use the lathe, the oil containers on top need
    to be turned a quarter turn to undo them to let the oil start to
    flow. These need to be closed off after you have finished using the
    lathe
  - There are 13 points that need to be oiled (16 on the diagram), place
    the can with a black tip of the metal bottle onto each point with a
    single squeeze to force oil into these points

## Safety Precautions

Please follow these safety precautions when using this machine, and
again, **DO NOT operate this machine if you have not been trained, or do
not feel confident with it**.

-   **Always ensure someone else is in the space when using the lathe**
-   **Always wear Eye Protection**
    -   Swarf can be very sharp, and the last place you want it is in
        your eye.
-   **Do not wear loose fitting clothes, especially anything with long
    loose sleeves. Short sleeve shirts/t-shirts are recommended.**
    -   Even though this is a small Lathe, this machine still has enough
        power to break you.
-   **Do not wear jewellery which could get caught in the machine. This
    includes bracelets, necklaces, watches etc.**
-   **Tie back long hair to keep it away from the work**
-   **NEVER LEAVE THE CHUCK KEY IN THE CHUCK**
    -   The chuck key has a home on the little metal plinth in front of
        the gear housing. Get in the habit of the chuck key being there
        when not in use.
-   **Keep fingers clear of a moving chuck and workpiece**
-   **Never reach over a moving chuck**
-   **Make sure that the work piece will not foul on any part of the
    lathe when turned on - always spin the chuck by hand before starting
    the machine**

There will probably be more to come over time, but these are some main
ones. Obviously, do not be an idiot, and think about what you are doing
first.

## Maintanance

  - Ensure the oilers are kept topped up, and opened when the lathe is
    in use
  - Oil all oiling points regularly - see the diagram on the right.


## Induction

Inductions are now available - please ask in the Weldy Grindy Telegram group or contact Mike Hindley via Telegram to arrange.

During this training session, trainees will be able to make a small decorative ring in brass and learn the following skills:

-   Health and safety
-   Using the 3-jaw chuck
-   Facing and turning to diameter
-   Drilling
-   Boring
-   Grooving and parting off

Other skills will be taught upon request - this can either be on
material supplied by the trainee (a project, for example), or the
material can be supplied by the space for a small fee.
