# Anodysing

The goal here is to do this without battery acid

long terms 3 tanks, really useful boxes
350mm x 220mm x 140mm

short term test with some small cups

## Pre-clean

One optional step we can do is a pre-clean to remove any grease or any surface contamination.
I can see two different ways of doing this.

  * One approach is chemical via a dip in Sodium Hydroxide or lye (2% dilute)
  * Second approach might be to just use the ultrasonic cleaner to do the pre-clean

Experiment with Scotchbrite or polish to get a shiny finish, maybe use the metal cleaning concentrate
If Sodium Hydroxide is used, make sure to rinse in water before the next step

## Etching Process

The next step is to etch the alu using Sodium Bisulfate

  * Make a 20 % solution of Sodium Bisulfate, (pool Ph down), also called sodium hydrogen sulfate.
  * Can also be thought of as 40 grams of sodium bisulfate in 160 ml of tap water.
  * Ph will be between 1 and 2. This can be increased up to 30% if needed.

For the power supply

  * Negative side should be attached to the cathode, a sheet of aluminum as large as the piece being anodysed
  * Positive side shoudl be attached to the anode or part, ideally via alu wire
  * 2.8 to 10 amps for one square foot of aluminum.
  * 1.5V - 6V DC

Start with 30 to 60 minutes.
A good indicator is that the piece will have a slightly yellow tinge as the index of refraction changes with cell growth. 

## Rinse

Rinse off the Sodium Bisulfate with distiled water.

## Dyeing

Make the RIT dye solution. General guideline is 5 ml liquid dye with color of choice to 250 ml of water.

  * Place the part into the dye at room temperature
  * Allow about 60 minutes and rinse the part in cold water.
  * If the color density is low, place it back in the dye bath for a longer period.

## Sealing

  * When the color is correct, place the piece in boiling water for 20 to 30 minutes to seal in the dye.
  * If a further protective coating is desired a clear coat of spray acrylic can be added to highlight the color.
