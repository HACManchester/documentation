# Experimental Setup

So far this is untested, but I'm documenting it here for anyone interested.
I think this should work just need to get around to trying it out some time.

Note as far as PPE glasses and rubber or latex gloves would be a must.

TODO Look at something long / tall for a tank

## Power Supply

For the power supply we could use the 12V car battery charger we have.  
Or one of the current controlled supplies from the electronics area.

  * The negative (- cathode) goes to the part to be plated
  * The positive (+ anode) goes to the source material to act as the plating

## Temperature

For the temperature it mentions they tested between 16° C.-60° C
and that it didn't seem to be temperature sensitive.
Also `In some cases, with some formulations, a dark oxide coating formed on the plated metal. This condition could be corrected by wiping the deposit off in some cases, or, in the case of some solutions, by increasing the oxalic acid concentration by 10%`


## Chemicals needed

The three chemicals we need are

  * Oxalic acid
  * Trisodium Phosphate - Available from amazon, typically labeled as paint cleaner
  * Ammonium Sulfate - Available from amazon as fertiliser

The last two seem to be available on amazon.
For the Oxalic acid one possible option is the use of a wood-bleach solution which has a 6% concentration.

### Oxalic acid

To calculate how much oxalic acid is in a 6% solution / 500ml Bottle

  * https://shop.hdchemicals.co.uk/blogs/news/how-to-use-oxalic-acid

If we mixed 60g of oxalic acid and 940ml of water this would result in a 6% solution
So for the wood bleach
940ml / 500ml = 1.88 reduction factor
60g / 1.88 = 31.91g
so I think this means we have 31.91g of oxalic acid in the 500ml bottle


### Overall solution

The examples given in the patent tend to use 32g oxalic acid within 1L of water.
This means we can dilute the wood bleach to 3% by adding another 500ml of water to make it 1L of solution
Then all we need is around 10 g trisodium phosphate and 4 g ammonium sulfate

The actual concentration from what I can gather doesn't matter, it just impacts the speed at which the plating takes place.
The other factor that influences the speed of the plating is the distance between the cathode and anode.
