# Metals that can be plated

So far I've not tried this yet but accoording to the patent
They've managed to plate

## Source Metals

  * Brass
  * Copper
  * Nickel
  * Zinc
  * Silver
  * Gold
  * Iron
  * Molybdenum-nickel-based alloys such as that sold under the Monel trademark
  * Lead
  * Stainless steel

## Destination Metals (substrates)

Onto the following:

  * Aluminum
  * Steel
  * Copper
  * Brass
  * Steel
  * Stainless steel
  * Lead
  * Zinc
  * Nickel

## Alloys

One of the more interesting things mentioned in the patent is the creation of alloys

```
Metal alloys may be made by providing anodes of different metals.
For example, zinc and copper anodes were used simultaneously to produce a layer of brass on a cathode.
Likewise, tin and copper anodes were used to produce bronze.
Nickel and iron anodes were used to make a nickel steel plating.
Other alloys can be plated onto a substrate in like manner using two or more anodes.
The electroplating solutions have been able to accomplish this without the addition of plating metal salts, chelates, complexes or the like to the plating solution.
The plating solution may be usable with other plating metals and substrate metals.
Rather, the plating metal was provided solely by the anode.
