# Universal Electro Plating

## Overview

To give a bit of history a long while ago there was a youtube video posted by someone called Robbert Murray Smith
This video highlighted a patent surrounding a universal plating solution.
Universal in the sense of being able to plate any metal onto any other conductive material.

The patent and original video are located here.
However the video is now locked off to members only.

## Advantages

Advantages of this are

  * It can plate any metal instead of being forumlated for just one metal
  * It's less toxic and easier to dispose of
  * It avoids giving off dangerous gasses
  * You can remove any metal ions left in the solution afterwards by just running it with a carbon anode.
    So it can be re-used for a different metal later on
  * It's free of cyanide and chloride compounds

## Regulation

For a while you could buy this solution directly from a shop Robbert had set up.
But what I think happened is that they decided to regulate access to one of the chemicals within the UK
More speciically the Oxalic acid crystals.

It's now only possible to buy the Oxalic acid in a solution form where the concentration is less than 10%
Gaining access to it in solid form is only possible if your a beekeeper or running a professional wood working company.

It is possible to gain access to solutions of less than 10% however and one possible source is wood bleach
