We have a bandsaw in the workshop. This is used for making long straight
cuts in sheet material, like acrylic or plywood. Please don't use it
unless you've had a safety briefing - it is very easy to accidentally
injure yourself with it.

The bandsaw will fill up with dust internally over time, so please open
the case and hoover out inside periodically.

Inserts
-------

The bandsaw has a replaceable wooden insert in the table. If this is too
loose, wobbles, is chipped, or has an excessively large hole, it may
need replacing. There are spares in the blades box, but if they have all
been used, you will need to make more.

1.  Obtain some 6mm ply. Cut into 50x50mm squares.
2.  Smooth the edges on the sander, to remove the rough parts. If the
    blanks are slightly too wide, correct this now.
3.  Round the corners of the blanks - the disc sander is good for this.
    This does not need to be perfect, but needs to be done or they will
    not fit.
4.  Set the fence to be in line with the edge of the slot, and with the
    old insert in, make a cut until the new insert aligns with the old.
    Do not cut the blank in two.
5.  Place the spare ones in the container in the blades box. (It is
    significantly easier to make lots at once)
