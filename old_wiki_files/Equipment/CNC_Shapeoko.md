Ownership
---------

The CNC Shapeoko2 was on loan on a long term basis from Simon. We have
since given it back as we upgraded to the [OxCNC](OxCNC "wikilink")

Documentation
-------------

Most of the documentation for this CNC is currently located on github

-   <http://hacmanchester.github.io/Tools.Shapeoko2/>

Induction
---------

Richard has most of the details on how to use the CNC. Although the aim
is to include as much documentation in the gitrepo on step by step
guides for its use
