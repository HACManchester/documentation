| 2014-05-21 | Added air assist nozzle, ran air assist tube to top right, soaked + cleaned bed, cleaned lens                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink")                                   |
| 2014-05-26 | Added cable chain for air assist tube, added inline connector for lights, replaced cable to i2c display with proper shielded one.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink")                                   |
| 2014-06-23 | Took out FFC and cut off / replaced the end of it at gantry end to get X axis moving again. Re-crimped endstop connector at LAOS end because crimping was rubbish.                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink")                                   |
| 2014-06-26 | FFC connector had failed - Replaced FFC entirely with ribbon cable and adaptor boards designed for CNC machine. Should be a lot more sturdy, but is currently ziptied to base of X axis motor until I think of a better plan. Might design specific board for it.                                                                                                     | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink")                                   |

| 2014-07-23 | X axis was stalling out due to insufficient current. Increased the amount available to both X and Y Axis motors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink")                                   |
| 2014-07-28 | Changed PWM Minimum to 20/255 instead of 40/255 to prevent charring on engrave.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | [Tas](User:NbHacker "wikilink")                                  |
| 2014-10-26 | Upgraded firmware to laoslaser-26-10-2014.bin - should fix engraving errors where the end of a line gets a little line on it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink")                                   |

Full clean and realign.                                                                                                                                                                                            | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink") + [Tas](User:NbHacker "wikilink") |
| 2014-11-15 | Drilled the X axis offset spacers to 2.5mm, tapped to M3, to replace the m2.5 screws that sheared off. Levelled bed and dropped it a bit to correct focus.                                                                                                                                                                                                            | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink") + [Tas](User:NbHacker "wikilink") |
| 2014-11-25 | Replaced X axis opto endstop with microswitch. Fuck opto endstops.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink")                                   |
| 2014-11-29 | Reduced cutting speed & belt tension to stop stall out on fast moves. Realigned and Relevelled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink") + [Tas](User:NbHacker "wikilink") |
| 2014-12-12 | Swapped out stepper driver on X axis, changed config to double steps/m (32 microsteps instead of 16), adjusted stepper driver power.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | [Tas](User:NbHacker "wikilink")                                  |
| 2014-12-12 | Built new cable to test stepper directly from driver. Still had issue. Switched around drivers, still had issue. Tested motor separately with no belt, X axis motor is fucked. Replaced Motor, restored original stepper driver + config, halfed steps/m because new motor goes twice as far per step. Rebuilt and did basic realign. Still needs full realign. Wept. | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink")                                   |
| 2014-01-31 | Replaced tube, rebuilt and cleaned X-Y axes, added new mechanical endstop to Y axis to replace shitty opto flag. Replaced feet with rubber feet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | [Bob](User:parag0n "wikilink")                                   |
