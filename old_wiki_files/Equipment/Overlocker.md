This machine is for giving sewing projects a strong and professional
edge, and has multiple ways of finishing the seam. It's a complex piece
of equipment, and as such, it requires an induction. The manual, unlike
that of the sewing machines, is less 'suggested reading' and more of a
requirement to use the machine correctly and get the best results.

While this machine is relatively robust, we advise against working on it
with seriously heavy materials - you're likely to break the needles at
minimum, and be forced to re-thread the machine, which is a non-trivial
task. Forcing through overly heavy fabric can break the machine entirely
too, as can too many layers of fabric. While it may not give as good a
finish, we suggest the use of our [Singer 4423 Heavy Duty Sewing
machine](Sewing_Machines "wikilink") instead.
