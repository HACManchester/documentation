Safety Precautions
------------------

Please follow these safety precautions when using this machine, and
again, **DO NOT operate this machine if you have not been trained, or do
not feel confident with it**.

-   **Do not get your hands anywhere close to the blade, push-sticks
    only.**
-   Do not try to use the table saw like a bandsaw it's for straight
    cuts only, don't try to curve anything
-   **Never remove the riving knife**
-   Always try to set the blade height just above the height of the wood
    (not too high)
-   Only push the wood away from you in the correct direction
-   Safety googles / PVE etc is required (possibly ear protection if you
    want to be fussy)
-   Try to keep your body out of line of the cut if possible
-   Make sure your not cutting through nails or screws, especially on
    the wood planer, this could damage the blade
