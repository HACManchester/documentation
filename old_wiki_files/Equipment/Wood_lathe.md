We have a Draper wood lathe in the woody/dusty area. This is a **work in
progress** and is not yet fully ready for use.

When completed it should be able to turn projects on a faceplate or
between centres. There is an aspiration to add a four-jaw chuck for
projects that require a chuck.

This lathe is for wood projects. For metal/plastic projects, see
[Myford_ML_7_Lathe](Myford_ML_7_Lathe "wikilink")

Manuals
-------

We have been unable to locate a PDF manual for the Draper lathe, but the
following manual (for a Clarke CWL12D) appears to describe an identical
tool.
