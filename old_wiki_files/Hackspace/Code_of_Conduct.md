Code of Conduct
---------------

Examples included in the code of conduct are just that, this is not an
exhaustive list of behaviours that may be considered in breach of the
rules.

1.  Our Hackspace is inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist,
    transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour.
    Do not make exclusionary jokes, even "ironically".
2.  Don’t harass people. Physical contact or sexual attention without
    enthusiastic consent is harassment, or if taken to its extreme,
    abuse. Wearing revealing clothes or flirting are not necessarily
    consent. If you're asked to stop do so, if you're not sure the
    person is happy with what you are doing ask.
3.  Aggression and elitism are unwelcome - knowledge is not a
    competition.
4.  Although alcoholic drinks are allowed in the space, there is no
    expectation or pressure to drink alcohol or conversely not to drink
    alcohol. However, those who are obviously intoxicated will be asked
    to leave the space.
5.  We’d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it
    wrong, apologise. Mistakes happen, however you should always use the
    person's preferred pronouns when addressing or discussing them.
6.  People's private lives are their own. Do not share details about
    others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but
    is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing,
    relationship or financial status.
7.  Respect other peoples belongings and space.
    1.  If possible ask before moving people's things.
    2.  If a machine appears to be in use check if the person has
        finished before taking over.
    3.  Don't spread your things too far and tidy up as you go along -
        others may be trying to work in the same area. If you're in the
        space on your own it's easy, and tempting, to spread out, be
        aware of others coming in and be prepared to stop working in
        order to create space for them.
    4.  Follow the bylaws regarding storage and leaving projects out in
        the space.
    5.  Don't mess around with other peoples' projects and possessions
        without their permission.
8.  Discussion of how to make our Hackspace more inclusive is welcome.
    Claims that this "has gone too far" aren’t.

If you have any concerns about someone's behaviour please let us know
either in person, or by emailing <board@hacman.org.uk>. If you do not
wish to email the whole board, individual board members can be contacted
via <firstname>@hacman.org.uk

### Consequences

#### Warnings

It is better to let someone know that their behaviour is liable to break
the code of conduct prior to it actually doing so than issue them with a
[warning](warnings "wikilink").

Any member can issue a warning to a person whose behaviour has broken
the code of conduct. Warnings should be reported to board@hacman.org.uk
as soon as practical. The report should include:

-   identifying information (name/nickname/description) of the person
-   the time and date the warning was issued
-   the behaviour that was in violation
-   the approximate time the behaviour occurred (if different to the
    warning)
-   the circumstances surrounding the incident
-   your identity
-   other people involved in the incident

#### Asking people to leave

**Non-members**

Any non-member who breaks the Code of Conduct can be asked to leave by
any member, this includes non-members who are guests of members.

**Members**

If a board member is present they get to make a decision about whether
one (or all) of the member(s) have to leave the space. If no board
member is present any two or more members who have witnessed the
incident(s) may ask the member (or members) to leave the space.

Do not put yourself in danger: if the situation requires it call the
police.

Criminal behaviour will not be tolerated.

#### Restriction of access and termination of membership

Membership of the Hackspace may be restricted or terminated by the board
for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some
general guidelines as to behaviour likely to cause restriction or
termination of membership:

-   receiving three or more warnings from different sources within 6
    months
-   continuing with behaviour after you have been asked to stop
-   a pattern of harassing behaviour, whether or not warnings have been
    issued
-   a single serious or obviously intentional offence such as taking
    compromising photographs (e.g. up their skirt), punching or groping
    someone

In the event of a serious accusation the board reserves the right to
suspend the accused's access to the Hackspace while investigations are
carried out.

#### Reporting inappropriate behaviour to the board

Any member can take a report from someone who has received harassment
and pass that information to the board.

When taking a report from someone who has received harassment you should
record faithfully what they say and reassure them that they are being
taken seriously however, you should avoid making specific promises
regarding the actions of the board.

Ask for information the reporter has not volunteered (such as time and
place of incident(s)) but do not pressure them into giving details if
they do not feel comfortable doing so. Even if the report lacks key
details (such as the identity of the person engaging in the harassing
behaviour) it should still be recorded and passed to the board. If the
reporter desires it arrange for an escort by a trusted person, contact a
friend or family member to come and support them and/or contact the
local police. Do not pressure the reporter into taking any actions they
do not wish to. Respect the reporters' privacy, do not discuss their
report outside the reporting structure (don't break the code of conduct
yourself).

The report should include (as far as practicable):

-   the identity of the perpetrator (name/nickname/description)
-   time and date of the incident
-   time and date the report was received (if different)
-   the identity of the victim
-   your identity
-   the behaviour - this can be couched in general terms if the report
    requires it
-   the circumstances surrounding the incident
-   other people involved in the incident

#### Public statements

As a general rule members of Manchester Hackspace should avoid making
public statements about the behaviour of individual people in relation
to the code of conduct.

The board will make as much detail about bans and current warnings as
they feel appropriate available to all members. This will usually be via
the wiki.

### Summary

If you have been asked to stop behaving in a certain way, do so. It's
fine to ask what it is you're doing that is upsetting the person if it
is not clear, but you shouldn't ask why the person is upset by it, it's
enough that they are.

If you have to take action to stop someone behaving in a way contrary to
the Code of Conduct do so, if possible consult with other members and/or
the board, however, if action is required take it and explain later.
