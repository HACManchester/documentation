Stockport Hackspace

An email was sent out in mid-june 2009 by [Jon
Spriggs](User:JonTheNiceGuy "wikilink"), asking about interest in
starting a hackerspace group in the Stockport area. A meeting was held
on 25th of June 2009 in the Grey Horse Pub, Reddish, and Stockport
Hackspace was formed, planning to rent a space in nearby Broadstone
Mill. After some encouraging initial meetings with the architect at
Broadstone, the Property Managers got involved, and the price
skyrocketed out of the group's reach.

The group then spent several months meeting in pubs around Stockport,
looking for alternative affordable spaces, and discussing everything
from [Arduinos](http://www.arduino.cc/), to which OS is best
([Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)).

In late 2009, the group were contacted by a member of
[MCC](http://mcc-hub.org/), asking if they wanted to use a room in MCC's
new HQ, Factory 2010, a building just inside the Mancunian Way. They
decided to pursue this idea, and voted to move future meetings into
Manchester City Centre, and rebrand.

The group's name changed to Hacking & Artistic Community, Manchester (or
HACMan) in late December/early January 2010, and the meetings moved
nearer to the centre of Manchester, namely to The Bull's Head Pub.

Unfortunately, in February 2010 MCC were forced to cancel the Factory
2010 project, leaving HACMan again without a space.

However, the move into Manchester had opened up the door for more
collaboration between HACMan and other groups in Manchester, and as of
late February 2010 the group had started working closely with
[MadLab](http://madlab.org.uk) in the Northern Quarter.

By July 2010, hacman were meeting every Wednesday and on the third
Saturday monthly at Madlab.

Hackspace Manchester
--------------------

In June 2012, due to time and space constraints, we decided it was time
to move on from Madlab. We found another space just down the road at
\#44 Edge Street, and took occupancy as of the beginning of August 2012.

Hackspace Manchester is run under the regular hackspace model, with rent
and bills paid by membership fees, and the members voting to elect a
board of trustees, who make sure the bills are paid and the space
continues to function.
