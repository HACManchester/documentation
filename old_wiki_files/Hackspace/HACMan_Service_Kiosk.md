The HACMan Service Kiosk (name pending) is a useful and easy to use
kiosk positioned next to the entrance/exit, and will provide information
such as the current time, recent members who have entered, IRC/Telegram
viewing, a direct entry system to allow guests to enter, viewing the
outer door camera (when implemented), and a race timer for members to
gain superiority on the leaderboard! (racing between the outer and inner
doors)
