About the Space
---------------

<onlyinclude> 44 Edge Street was the first home of HAC:Man, and is
located above Teacup, which is just 2 doors down from Madlab.

The space had several areas, including 2 workshops, the electronics
workbench, and the main social table(s).

Access to the space was through the door on Edge Street, which has a big
44 above it, as well as our sign in the window above that.

Off Limit Areas
---------------

Due to the nature of the rental agreement, there are places in the space
that are off limits to members, unless they have explicit permission.

### Bio Lab

The Bio Lab, located under the windows, is not to be entered unless
necessary, such as to open or close the windows, and to turn on or off
the sign.

### Offices

The Offices to the rear of the building (on the Thomas Street side) are
owned and used by Madlab.

### Fire Exit

This leads directly into an office next door, and so should ONLY be used
in the case of the space breaking Rule 0 (see above). No access through
this door at any time otherwise.
