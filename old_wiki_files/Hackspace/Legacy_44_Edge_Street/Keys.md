The Keys!
=========

There are 5 keys in a full set for \#44:

-   Shutter Key
-   2x Front Door Mortice Keys
-   1x Front Door Cylinder key
-   1x Space door key

Buying Keys
===========

The sets currently cost £23/set, but we need to get keys made in sets of
2 to get this pricing.

-   The Shutter and Mortice Keys are bought from the locksmith int he
    arndale market for £33 / 2 sets (buy 1 set for £22, get 1 set half
    price)
-   The Front Door Key is bought from Central Locksmiths for £6.50 a key
    -   Will double check to see how much a full set would cost from
        Central Locksmiths - they are generally better.

Any member can become a keyholder. Keys must be returned to a board
member if the keyholder stops being a member.
