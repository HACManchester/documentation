If you are the last person out of the space, please make sure to do the
following:

WorkShop
--------

1.  If you have made a mess, tidy it up! Even the best-intentioned
    people miss some things, so if you can clean up your mess and 10% of
    someone else's, things will even out.
2.  Close the windows.
3.  Make sure the benches are turned off. The 2 main workbenches all
    have isolation switches on the front. The electronics bench has one
    at the back right under the shelves
4.  Make sure the tools are turned off.

Bins
----

-   If there are any full bin bags, please take as many as you can
    downstairs and put them in the big metal bins.
-   If any bins look full or close to the point where you couldn't tie
    the bag off, please remove the bag and tie it. Replace the bag with
    a spare from the roll in snackspace. Take the full bag outside if
    you can or at least leave it by the door.

Kitchen
-------

1.  Make sure any cups and glasses have been washed and the taps are
    turned off.
