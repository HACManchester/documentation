Hi so you've joined the Manchester hackspace.
Below is a general overview of the do's and don'ts while in the space

### Please Do

-   When using tools please place them back where you found them. It can
    be very frustrating for other members if a tool is misplaced and
    can't be found, especially if it has been donated.
-   Please **tidy up** when making a mess. Using tools in the woody
    dusty area and leaving a mess of wood and dust for example is
    generally not cool, since it just means someone else has to tidy it
    up.
-   Don't be afraid to report when something breaks. If you'd tried to
    be careful but a tool is no longer working don't be afraid to
    mention something has gone wrong (such as the belt wearing out on
    the belt sander for example)
-   Please read the [Citizen Hacman
    Commitment](https://list.hacman.org.uk/t/citizen-hacman-a-revised-membership-agreement-and-hackspace-rules-final/2609)

### Can I?

-   **Can I paint the walls / things?**

It's best to ask permission before painting walls or things in general
(on Telegram is a good idea).
Putting graffiti on the walls is generally not a polite thing to do and
we aim to be as inclusive as possible for all members.

-   **Can I use the large dangerous tools?**

Generally for insurance reasons we tend to have to give an induction on
the big tools to make sure we're covered. The main number one rule is
that no-one should be allowed to use one of the big dangerous tools
(like the table saw) while they're alone in the space.
**For the big tools at least one other person needs to be present
somewhere in the space.**

-   **Can I help make the space better?**

Most certainly although if in doubt join in on the conversation on the
main telegram channel

### Induction List

This is a list of tools that require special care / an induction for use

#### Laser Cutter

To use the laser cutter you first need to book an induction via
Telegram, and you need to be a member
We need to be careful with the laser cutter, it's one of the few tools
we charge for using because of the glass tube that needs to be
periodically replaced (and is quite expensive)

-   Please book an induction on the members portal
-   Also please contact someone on telegram [Telegram

#### CNC

To use the CNC an induction is required, it's more complex to use than
the laser cutter as it's basically a computer controlled milling bit
that operates in 3 dimensions. It has the advantages over the laser
cutter in that it can work with thicker materials or materials that
wouldn't normally be allowed for use with the laser cutter.

-   Please book an induction on the members portal

#### Metal Lathe

The metal lathe is a fairly precise instrument and is quite powerful.
Currently the number of members that can give an induction is a bit
limited so please be patient
