Snackspace is (mostly) full of wonderful organic consumables for many of
the life forms that use the space! The items are usually priced either
with a purple star, or on the board to the side, and can be exchanged
for coinage. If you are a member, we also have a small honesty system
that allows you to put your name on the other board, and have a 'space
owes you' or 'I owe the space' figure to help minimise the fumbling with
change. Except when we have to count it all!

Snackspace is run and organised by [Team
Procurement](Team_Procurement "wikilink"), who manage the sourcing of
the snacks that people want to buy - please message us if you have any
suggestions!

We have a 'snackspace run' limit of £200 to encourage more frequent,
smaller buying sprees. This should allow us to have less waste from
things going out of date, allow us to keep a varied range of things in
stock, and stop us putting our backs out carrying it all into the space.
To this end, we have now got a [Hancocks
card](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Hancocks/@53.471005,-2.193808,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x74ae9fefe5d30e01!8m2!3d53.471005!4d-2.193808),
as well as a [makro
card](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Makro+Manchester/@53.4630013,-2.3967165,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487ba944249e094f:0x62e4b59a6942b0f5!8m2!3d53.4630013!4d-2.3945278),
which should make for quicker food runs. For noodle pots, we go to [Wing
Yip](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Wing+Yip+Ltd/@53.48678,-2.2288292,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x8535abdd87df9ea4!8m2!3d53.48678!4d-2.2288292).
