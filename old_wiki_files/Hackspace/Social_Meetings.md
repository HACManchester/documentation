Social meetings happen every Wednesday, at the
[Hackspace](http://hacman.org.uk/locations/4/Hackspace%20Manchester/).

What Happens?
-------------

Soldering, breaking things, building robots, flashing LEDs, painting,
anything electronics or crafty!

As always though, there is no definite pattern to these Social meetings,
so the best idea is to bring yourself and possibly something
interesting, or your current project, and have fun!
