Specification Space 4.0
-----------------------

These are the original specs for Space 3.0 which we're in at the
moment
<https://hacman.org.uk/space-3-0/>

### Notes

-   Avoid office spaces, since people may not be happy about the noise
    and fumes, probably more light industrial / old mills
-   business use is B1-8
-   We are looking for a Light Industrial/Workshop space.
-   Make sure to check if noise is an issue

The stuff we need in a space includes:

### Essential

Minimum Viable Product: these are the things that we must have in order
to function as a makerspace:

    anywhere)
-   24 hour access
-   In Central Manchester (within the red circle) & near good transport
    links (bus/tram/train)
-   One external wall for fume extraction purposes (other walls, floor

    £9.50(inc) per square foot (Most quoted prices on EA webistes will
    be ex vat)
