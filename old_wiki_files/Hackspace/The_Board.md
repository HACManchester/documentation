Hacman has a board of directors, who ensure that the space can continue
to exist. They're primarily there to do paperwork, handle legal issues
such as making sure rent and bills get paid, and deal with personal
member stuff such as signups, direct debits, and bans.

Hackerspaces traditionally have very flat hierarchies, and Hacman is no
exception - the board is **not** here to tidy or fix things in the
space, make important decisions, or induct new members. These things are
**everyone**'s job

Elections
---------

The board are selected every year by an election, with all members in
good standing able to vote. This is held roughly once a year at the AGM,
which at the moment tends to be held towards the end of the year.

At each election, a third of the board retire by rotation. There are
presently 5 directors, but this number could change in the future if the
space grew (and the membership agreed to accordingly amend the
constitution)
