This page lists commonly suggested ideas for the space, and what
decisions were made about them

Store scrap 3d prints for recycling
-----------------------------------

We did this from 2012 to 2016. The scrap parts were never touched, and
the bin they were put in repeatedly had non-printerscrap put in it. We
decided to stop doing this in Feb 2016 as part of a drive to make the
space easier to clean.

Have a beam-break sensor in the doorway to figure out how many people are in the space
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Beam break sensors are terrible at actually counting how many people
have come into a building in realtime (generally they take the number of
beam breaks per day, and divide by two. Two people entering at once will
sometimes be miscounted as one person. Our membership is also generally
made up of people who enjoy low level trolling using this kind of sensor
to make to read 9001 people in the space.

Clamp down the second vise in the workshop
------------------------------------------

The double workbench in the workshop is designed to do double-duty as a
chop-saw stand. It needs a minimum of 1.2m of clearance at one side, and
2.4m at the other to allow it to be used in this manner.
