The electric screwdrivers we have in the space, while numerous, are all
shit. They all have either screwed up gearboxes, broken batteries, or
such a huge self discharge that the batteries are always completely
flat. The chargers for them are also ancient, so they use a lot of
electricity when not charging.

I'd like to look at buying a couple of nice, new, lithium battery
powered electric screwdrivers.

At home I have a set of Ryobi One+ tools, which are great. They last
forever, have good torque right to the end of the battery, and aren't
too expensive for the power. I used them last year to build all the grey
tables in the current space, and they're still going strong now. The
batteries are compatible across the whole range of tools, so we could
get an [Impact
Screwdriver](http://uk.ryobitools.eu/power-tools-en/drilling-and-screwdriving-en/rid1801-en/rid1801m-en/),
[Nail
Gun](http://uk.ryobitools.eu/power-tools-en/fix-finishing-tools-en/r18n18g-en/r18n18g-en/)
or [Chainsaw
Lance](http://uk.ryobitools.eu/outdoor-en/chainsaws-en/rpp1820-en/opp1820-en/)
at a later date and use the same batteries.

This pledge is to buy 2 of
[these](http://www.diy.com/departments/ryobi-one-plus-cordless-18v-li-ion-combi-drill-2-batteries-llcdi18022/196738_BQ.prd?gclid=Cj0KEQiAkdajBRCJ_7_j6sCck7wBEiQAppb2i7idRxk0l9bLv6D20b_x4LRrMj64R6arpzLdcPo4Qe0aAidx8P8HAQ&ecamp=SEAPLA196738_BQ&ef_id=U@CvKgAAAVLbb8lV:20141126172009:s)
packs from B&Q, giving us: 2x Hammer Drill / Screwdriver Bodies 4x
Lithium One+ batteries 2x One+ Chargers

And allowing us to dispose of all the rubbish existing screwdrivers.
