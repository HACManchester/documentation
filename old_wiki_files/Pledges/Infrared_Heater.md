Let's get hot!
--------------

Update! Things got really cold really fast. We realised we would need a
"Far IR" solution which is more expensive at roughly two hundred pounds.

Therefore we replaced our 1.5kw heater with a new 2.5kw one using this
pledge.

Thank you those involved.

-   The oil filled radiator is on its last wheels.
    -   Oil filled radiator isn't cutting it, can be knocked
        over/plugged in anywhere
    -   Circuit issue remains, extension reels aren't a good solution.
    -   Why not use infrared lamps??
    -   Benefits are vast:
        -   Safe - high up out of reach, away from flammable things,
            can't fall over/be kicked
        -   Dedicated circuit - that can't have other stuff plugged in
            so no melty moments
        -   Heats people and things, not air
        -   Can be mounted from ceiling or pillars for good coverage
        -   Timer switch for instant heat that doesn't stay on all night
            or risk being left on
        -   With them in place we can forbid plugging in of any heaters!
