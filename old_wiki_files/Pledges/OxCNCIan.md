We have been offered a 1000 x 750 OxCNC machine. It originally cost over
£1000, Its for sale for £800, and the seller is willing to knock £50 off
to make the total £750 if the Hackspace buys it.

This has a much larger and beefier frame than the shapeoko2 and should
be able to cut wood and plastic easily, aluminium fairly easily, and
steel very slowly.

-   Frame size 1000mm X 750mm
-   Cut size x = 561mm y = 740mm z = 60mm

-   Build documentation etc <https://github.com/thinkl33t/OxCNC>

Location wise, this could fit where the current CNC table is, and not
take up massively more room.

Uses
----

Its bed is big enough that we can use it to build a few things that
would be useful for the space:

-   Stools - <https://openbuilds.com/projects/cncstool.65/>
-   Nice wooden boxes that fit exactly in a member shelf
-   MOAR CLOCKS
-   Hanging brackets for tools
-   Stackable member's storage -
