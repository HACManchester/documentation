So, we've been offered a rather nice press break for folding metal - the
only problem is, it's in London and we'd have to pick it up!

These things weigh over 100kg, and are designed for folding metal sheets
to specific angles. This would make a great addition to the hackspace,
as we're slowly building out the metalworking space, and this is an
essential item in a metalworking shop if you're wanting to fabricate
lots of different items without cutting and welding lots.

We believe it's a [straight
folder](https://www.wnealservices.com/product/wns-straight-folder-1060mm-x-1-2mm-sf1060/)
like the one on that page, and if we can get it 'free', or really, for
the cost of delivery, that would be a huge saving on a new one.

As it weighs rather a lot, we'd be looking to rent a van to go there and
back (a transit will likely do fine).

Fahad has said he's happy to do the run, so we just need to pledge
drive!
