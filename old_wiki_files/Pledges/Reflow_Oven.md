Several of the members have expressed interest in a new reflow oven, and
so we're doing a pledge drive, organised by
[Matt](User:greyscale "wikilink").

We're looking to raise £160 for an Infra-Red chip heater, which is
apparently better than a standard reflow oven. The device will also do
correct temperature curves for chip drying and should be significantly
better and more accurate than a toaster oven. Seeing as the toaster oven
we currently have trips the breakers it can't be a bad idea!

Any extra funds will go towards materials and tools for it, such as
solder paste, fine syringes with fine filler tips, etc.

The device will be bought once the lowest price is obtained, likely
towards the end of the month.
