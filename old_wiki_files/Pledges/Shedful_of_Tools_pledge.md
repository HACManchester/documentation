Just found an ad for a shedfull of power and hand tools near me. The
sale price is £350, but it incudes a lot of things we've discussed
buying:

HI I HAVE A SHED FULL OF TOOLS EVERYTHING MUST GO IN ONE JOB LOT I CAN
NOT LIST ALL BUT HERE ARE SOME SOCKET SETS SCREW DRIVERS HAMERS BOXS OF
SCREW SPANNERS POWER DRILLS CORDLESS DRILLS JIGSAW COMPOUND MITE SAE
TABLE SAW POWER ROUTER GRINDER AIR COMPRESSORS AND LOTS MORE I DONT KNOW
WHOT THEY ALL ARE BE LONG TO MY LATE HUSBAND AND HE LOVED HIS TOYS

I'm willing to chuck in a hundred quid towards getting the tools for
hacman (fully fitting out the workshop would be great!), can anyone else
pledge towards it?
