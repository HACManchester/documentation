Soldering Station
=================

The hot-air gun on our soldering station is broken and we need a new
one. We've been offered one of these ones from farnell at a slight
cheaper than usual price, but only today!

This pledge drive is to pay for buying one of these solder stations,
with anything left over going into buying SMT assembly & soldering
equipment to go with it.

### Pledge Target £120.00

If people could please transfer their pledges to the hackspace bank
account with the reference HOTAIR to pay that'd be great.

If anyone needs the bank details who doesnt have them, just log into the
members site and go to the page at <https://hacman.org.uk/bank-details/>
for the details.
