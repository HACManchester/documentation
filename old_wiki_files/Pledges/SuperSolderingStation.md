Our grey soldering station has been faulty for a while and has now been
sent to the great tip in the sky. This has left us with one working
soldering iron on the electronics bench.

I propose we buy a PS-900 induction based soldering station, giving us a
much improved soldering experience. The
[PS900](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/32196.pdf) provides automatic
temperature control (so no fiddling with the temperature), improved tip
lifetime, automatic sleep on holstering and rugged design. These come
with the recommendation of several members who are using them in their
personal and professional capabilities.

The pledge is to buy 1 of
[PS900](http://www.farnell.com/datasheets/32196.pdf) soldering stations.

Update 2016-01-07
-----------------

I have found a ps-800 on ebay for £110 including postage. It is the
forerunner to the ps-900, and takes the same handles / tips.
