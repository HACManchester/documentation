<File:TankProg1.png%7CInitial> design layout using guesstimated
proportions. <File:TankProg3.png%7CA> more detailed design featuring an
interior frame. This was originally planned to be completely built from
scratch, until the wheelchair idea was implemented.
<File:TankProg5.png%7CInitial> design layout using guesstimated
proportions. <File:TankProg5.png%7CTrue> measurements are gathered to
create the final design of the interior frame. The grey objects
represent areas of the wheelchair, while yellow objects represent the
wood framework. Red objects are detail.

<File:WheelchairConstruction1.jpg%7CThe> wheelchair the tank would be
mounted onto. Found on eBay for Â£30!
<File:WheelchairConstruction2.jpg%7CAn> inner frame is constructed and
attached to the wheelchair. The outer frame will attach to this,
allowing for 'modules' to be attached or removed from the inner frame at
will. <File:WheelchairConstruction3.jpg%7CThe> top half of the outer
frame completed. <File:WheelchairConstruction4.jpg%7CThe> bottom half of
the outer frame completed. Taken for a test drive up the garden, it
works well! <File:WheelchairConstruction5.jpg%7CFoamboard> panels are
starting to be attached, to create the 'armour' of the tank.
