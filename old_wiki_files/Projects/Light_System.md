Spotlight system for madlab comprised of several spot light units.

Each unit has/can:

-   Pan/tilt (stepper motor/servo?)
-   Array of high-brightness LEDs or GU10 / MR16 Socket is a better
    option for low-voltage lighting
-   Individually dimmable
-   RGB?

All run to a central control / power unit

Maybe use DMX or similar to control

Preferably a visual, tactile control unit that looks cool.
