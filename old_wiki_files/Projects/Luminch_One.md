Project Aim
-----------

This part of a [larger project](User:Harvy200 "wikilink") to get started
in electronics, arduino programming, basic woodwork and paper craft.
This is essentially the [Luminch
One](http://makeprojects.com/Project/Luminch-One/1773/)

The aim of this project is to create a device that

-   Uses IR to control a lamp
-   Runs off the mains like a lamp
-   Have a decent lampshade design so it can actually be used
-   Replace arduino with cheaper, more permanent alternative

Hardware
--------

-   Any Arduino or compatible hardware
-   Super bright LED
-   IR distance sensor
-   Wood and Tracing paper

Prototypes
----------

The link to the original design has better schematics then I can make
but they are posted here for your convenience.

Software
--------

As before the source code to control the lamp from the IR input is
posted in the original link.
