Work Log
========

August 2010
-----------

Version 1 of the arcade machine was completed in mid 2010. The parts
were all fitted, the PC rebuilt,

18th September 2010
-------------------

On Software Freedom Day 2010, Bob did a live hack-a-thon, building a
teensy based RFID unit for the arcade machine. This allowed him to scan
his RFID tag, and automatically sent through 10 credits to the current
game. The unit shows up to the PC as a USB keyboard, and sends through
the credits by 'pressing' 5 repeatedly.

Late 2011
---------

During the workshop refit in late 2011, the arcade machine was damaged.
The chipboard shelf holding up the monitor snapped off the dowels that
were holding it in place, so the monitor glass and monitor were removed
while repairs were made.

8th February 2012
-----------------

Bob, Paul, and Tom spend a Wednesday evening rebuilding the arcade
cabinet. The old monitor shelf was replaced with a fixed shelf made of 2
sheets of 18mm plywood, and the speakers were rewired to use a new amp
as the old one had been nicked for the workshop sound system. All the
wiring was tidied up and an extension lead properly fixed inside.

The RFID system has been removed, and is being rebuilt to be a bit more
flexible.
