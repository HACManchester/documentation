The aim of this project is to design an RFID based lock system for the
Madlab Storage area, with a simple system for adding and removing
allowed cards, and to include a backup system for opening the door. This
system will eventually be modified to use Ethernet and a central
database for all cards, allowing the change of privileges quickly and
easily through an online database.

Project Aim
-----------

The aim of this project is to create a system that

-   Uses RFID technology for identification
-   Has a screen for interface
-   Has a simple menu for changing settings

Hardware
--------

-   Any Arduino or compatible hardware
-   16x2 LCD Screen (preferably with backlight)
-   4 buttons
-   RFID Reader

Prototypes
----------

The current and past versions of the hardware can be found here

-   **[Hardware v0.1](Madlab_Storage/Hardware_v01 "wikilink")** -
    Initial hardware layout - done in Eagle. includes schematic.
-   **[Hardware v0.2](Madlab_Storage/Hardware_v02 "wikilink")** -
    Completely re-done schematic layout and PCB layout. Easier to read
    Schematic, and PCB designed with minimal top layer for ease of
    creation with single sided manufacturing capabilities.

Software
--------

The current and past versions of the software can be found here

-   **[Software v01](Madlab_Storage/Software_v01 "wikilink")** - Version
    1 of the software with all basic functionality
-   **[Software v02](Madlab_Storage/Software_v02 "wikilink")** - Version
    2, with changes to the pin allocations to work with v0.2 of the PCB.
