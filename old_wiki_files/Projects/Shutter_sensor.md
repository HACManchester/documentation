Current sensor
--------------

The shutter sensor is a magnetic reed switch. There is a flat 8-strand
cable between the shutter sensor and the door of the hackspace. The
magnetic sensor is connected between the brown and grey wires of the
cable. These should be shorted out when the shutter is down.

Old Sensor
----------

There used to be a GP2D12 infra-red range finder attached to the shutter
frame, but this has now been retired.
