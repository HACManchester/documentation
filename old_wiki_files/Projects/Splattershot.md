The Splattershot is the default weapon from the upcoming Nintendo game
*[Splatoon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon)*. After being
revealed at [Nintendo's E3
Direct](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KLQz-7gCnI), I was eager to
create something from this fun little game, so I chose to have a go at
creating the ink gun that's used as the primary mechanic. I'm a fan of
making functional props, so it was also a fun challenge for me.

Since I only had the single game trailer and [a promo art
piece](http://a.pomf.se/rsbend.jpg) for reference, I started building
the gun around the template of a 2L cola bottle as the main holding tank
to set the key scale I would be using for all my pieces. Comparing this
bottle to the tank used in the game's version, I was able to slowly
build up each part of the gun in an accurate scale to the original.

Features
--------

-   Fires water from a detachable 2L bottle at the top of the gun
    through a 12v windscreen washer pump
-   Air intake valve to the bottle to prevent pressure building up
-   Trigger-activated
-   Master power switch behind the grip
-   Removable AA (or 9V) batteries for easy replacing/recharging
