Team Documentation is a group who maintain the vast documentation stores
that the hackspace has within its realm.

Basically, we look after this wiki, and our
[Github](https://github.com/HACManchester/) repository, while trying to
make it as easy as possible for people to access, edit, and work with
the documentation contained within. While it's not our purpose to write
all the documentation for the hackspace (we're here to enable the
members to do it), you'll occasionally see us racking up edits on the
wiki or pushing code on the github repo.

We'd love for you to join our team, so feel free to pop over to our
[Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/Agaj2UBrygQwTBBHDW8jyA), or
message us on the main hackspace telegram group.
