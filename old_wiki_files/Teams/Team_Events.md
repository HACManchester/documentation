Team Events helps organise events that hackspace members want to go to -
this includes maker events, community events, and other things where we
might want to show off all the fantastic things members get up to.

We'd love for you to join our team, so feel free to pop over to our
[Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/E4DcrUDWGvEzlsmJHNNkuQ), or
message us on the main hackspace telegram group.
