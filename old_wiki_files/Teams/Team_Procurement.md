We are the buying team!
-----------------------

We manage what the space buys, to make sure people have what they need.

We specifically look after purchasing for
[Snackspace](Snackspace "wikilink"), [The Shop](The_Shop "wikilink")
which sells bits for hacking such as arduinos and laser cuttable
materials, and [Consumables](Consumables "wikilink") for throughout the
space.

If you want to get involved, or have any suggestions, feel free to

Accounts and Accountability
---------------------------

As the procurement team, we're given budgets for different aspects of
the space, and are held accountable by three bodies - the treasurer,
[The Board](The_Board "wikilink"), and the membership in the
[MMMM](MMMM "wikilink") in which we report, monthly, on a monday, in a
meeting with the membership.

### Budgets

Snackspace's budget is £200 per snackspace run, aiming for smaller
shopping sprees to limit the chance of loss through items passing their
sell-by dates.

The current [Consumables](Consumables "wikilink") budget is £30 per
month, and that includes parts, repairs, etc to equipment.

Any spending above those amounts for any reason requires board approval.

### Reimbursements and Receipts

Where possible, it's prefered that a board member pays using the company
debit card, and as soon as reasonably practicable photographs the
receipt and sends it to treasurer@hacman.org.uk - this reduces the load
on the treasurer for reimbursements.

Where a board member isn't available, photos of receipts and bank
details for reimbursements should be sent to board@hacman.org.uk as
quickly as possible - the maximum time allowed between the purchase and
the receipts being submitted is one month, unless there are exceptional
circumstances.

This allows us to manage cash flow and budgets, and makes sure we have
transparency on what we spend as a hackspace. It also helps us to report
correctly to the [MMMM](MMMM "wikilink").
