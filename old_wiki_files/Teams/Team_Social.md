Team Social, also known as Team Friend Face, we market and advertise the
hackspace over social media. We also are normally the first port of call
for new members to get involved. We maybe also expand to organising
social events.

We'd love for you to join our team, so feel free to pop over to our
[Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/GV5-bRG75SGTJ0rxOjk2kQ), or
message us on the main hackspace telegram group for an invite.
