Welcome to the home of the Team Woodwork, responsible for looking after,
maintaining, and growing the [Woody Dusty](Woody_Dusty "wikilink") area,
as well as training people up on our equipment!

This area is mainly for working with wood, and some plastics. We have a
well-stocked workspace with plenty of tools and equipment, and provide
training for any of the equipment that requires it.

We have a [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/AYtZgkk7n1MqvkN9N2fmsA)
if you want to get involved!

Consumables
-----------

These are items that the hackspace classes as consumables, and we and
Team Purchasing aim to keep in stock for our area. We have a small
budget for this so we encourage donations, and have donation jars around
the space.
