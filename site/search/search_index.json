It is a community. The infrastructure (building, equipment, tools, electric, internet etc) provides the foundations, and people working together with shared understandings and expectations are what provide a place of strong community. Every member is a citizen of the Hackspace Community and as such must follow the rules and guidelines in place to ensure that the community can exist safely and cohesively. The Citizen Hacman Commitment is what we expect from all Hackspace Citizens and explains how you can play your part in building, maintaining, and growing our community. Examples included in the Citizen Hacman Commitment are just that, this is not an exhaustive list of behaviours that may be considered in breach of the rules. As a Citizen of Hacman\u2026 I am committed to: Membership Conditions Hackspace Manchester is open to everyone over the age of 18 who registers at https://members.hacman.org.uk/register and pays a monthly subscription fee of at least \u00a310 per month. Rule 0 - DO NOT BE ON FIRE A hacker may not be on fire, cause a fellow hacker to be on fire, or through inaction allow a fellow hacker to be on fire. As a Hackspace Citizen it is essential that you act responsibly and safely within the Space this includes but is not limited to: Using appropriate PPE. Hackspace Manchester provides relevant PPE including goggles, breathing masks, gloves, hearing protection etc and these should be used where appropriate. Using tools safely - Tools and equipment that require an induction must not be used until you have been inducted on them. Tools that do not require an induction may be used and use of such tools will be taken as an acknowledgement that your comfortable using these tools. Reporting any accidents, near misses, and unsafe usage to the Hackspace Health & Safety subcommittee via the Hackspace Helpdesk Only using tools that have been identified as NOT SAFE FOR LONE WORKING when someone else is present in the Space. Rule 1: Be excellent to each other (follow the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement) A hacker should treat each and every other hacker with the respect we feel we deserve ourselves. We want our Hackspace to be somewhere that people can enjoy making things in a safe, harassment-free environment. Anybody who is in the Hackspace, attending an event as part of the Hackspace or is using any of the Hackspace communication channels (IRC, Mailing List or Telegram) is covered by the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement. Rule 2: Colour within the lines (and erase afterwards) A hacker should keep their belongings safe and tidy so that other hackers are not inconvenienced or injured by them. Follow the member\u2019s storage guidelines Don\u2019t spread your stuff all over the place. Be willing to make room for others to work when needed Tidy up any mess you make including tidying tools up and putting them back in the right places, disposing of rubbish appropriately If you can please try and spend a few minutes tidying up other people\u2019s mess (no one is perfect and someone may have left something out and by tidying it you\u2019re helping keep the space enjoyable for everyone) Rule 3: Appreciate the Space! A hacker should appreciate the space and that it is a shared space with other Hackspace Citizens . All Hackspace Citizens are asked to respect and appreciate the space including but not limited to: Tidying up after yourself Carrying out Housekeeping tasks such as taking the rubbish out, hoovering up, watering the plant etc) Reporting any broken/damaged tools or infrastructure via the Hackspace Helpdesk Promptly paying for snackspace, laser and other equipment fees Taking care not to damage tools or infrastructure Helping to improve the space by taking part in Hack the Space Days where possible or getting involved in the teams/subcommittees responsible for the running of the space. Getting involved with Space Bureaucracy through the Members Meetings and voting in the elections. Not borrowing/removing tools from the space or expecting tools to be available. We do not guarantee the uptime or availability of equipment. (No refunds will be given for membership just because a tool is out of use) Members may bring guests into the space but are responsible for the actions of the guests. Guests must not use any equipment that requires an induction and should not be left alone in the space. Ensuring you follow Access Control protocols including closing doors when leaving, not propping doors open unnecessarily and not giving others access to the space or space systems via your RFID fob, Login information or other authentication methods Comply with all relevant legislation including but not limited to: Following the principles of the Health and Safety at Work Act No Smoking (including vaping) within the Space No illegal activities e.g bringing stolen goods into the space No sleeping/living in the space You may use the hackspace to further your business objectives but keep in mind that this is a shared space and that you won\u2019t be given nor should you expect any priority or special treatment so please plan your deadlines accordingly. Rule 4: No Obligation Hackspace Manchester does not employ any staff. Volunteers give up their spare time to assist with inductions on equipment and to help keep the space running, therefore, please bear in mind the following: Equipment inductions are done by volunteers and there may be a wait for these Maintenance of tools and equipment is done by volunteers which means that it may take a while for tools to be fixed if damaged/out of service There is no obligation on Hackspace Manchester to purchase new tools and equipment. The majority of space tools were funded by member pledges so if you wish we had a tool or piece of equipment feel free to start a pledge on the Forum There is no obligation on you to remain a member, membership is monthly rolling and can be cancelled at anytime using the Member\u2019s system. Just because someone is in the space doesn\u2019t mean they are willing to induct you or fix something at that time Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement As a condition of my membership to Hackspace Manchester I agree to the following: To follow the rules and guidelines of Hackspace Manchester Hackspace Manchester is a safe and inclusive space, free from violence, harassment, hate speech or exclusionary behaviour. This includes but is not limited to: Making exclusionary jokes (even \u201cironically\u201d) Harassing or bullying of others (if you need to know what harassment covers see wikipedia ) Using language or engaging in activity that is homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, sexist or otherwise exclusionary. Engaging in any activity that involves others without all parties have given their consent (consent is defined as an informed, affirmative decision made freely and actively by all parties to engage in mutually acceptable activity). Making an assumption of others including (but not limited) any perceived gender, sexual orientation or religion. If you are unsure then we would rather you asked and apologise if you are mistaken, however, respect other people\u2019s privacy - they have the right not to answer any specific questions regarding their life. People\u2019s private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status. Don\u2019t judge - instead share your knowledge! Knowledge is not a competition - instead of judging people for what they don\u2019t know, help them. Elitism is not welcome in the space. When doing this, remember that different people have different approaches, and may not want your help. *Here at the Hackspace we make things, including mistakes! * Alcoholic drinks are permitted within the Hackspace however there should be no expectation or pressure on anyone to drink alcohol or conversely not to drink alcohol. No tools or equipment should be operated by anyone under the influence of alcohol (or other substances) Anyone who is obviously intoxicated will be asked to leave the space Respect other peoples belongings and space. If possible ask before moving other people\u2019s things. If a machine appears to be in use check if the person has finished before taking over. Don\u2019t spread your things too far and tidy up as you go along - others may be trying to work in the same area. If you\u2019re in the space on your own it\u2019s easy, and tempting, to spread out, be aware of others coming in and be prepared to stop working in order to create space for them. Follow the rules regarding storage and leaving projects out in the space. Don\u2019t mess around with other peoples\u2019 projects and possessions without their permission. Discussion of how to make our Hackspace more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this \u201chas gone too far\u201d aren\u2019t. If you have any concerns about someone\u2019s behaviour please let us know either in person or by emailing board@hacman.org.uk. If you do not wish to email the whole board, individual board members can be contacted via firstname@hacman.org.uk Consequences Warnings It is better to let someone know that their behaviour is liable to break the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement prior to it actually doing so than issue them with a warning. Any member can issue a warning to a person whose behaviour has broken the code of conduct. Warnings should be reported to board@hacman.org.uk as soon as practical. The report should include: identifying information (name/nickname/description) of the person the time and date the warning was issued the behaviour that was in violation the approximate time the behaviour occurred (if different to the warning) the circumstances surrounding the incident your identity other people involved in the incident Asking people to leave Non-members Any non-member who breaks the Code of Conduct can be asked to leave by any member, this includes non-members who are guests of members. Members If a board member is present they get to make a decision about whether one (or all) of the member(s) have to leave the space. If no board member is present any two or more members who have witnessed the incident(s) may ask the member (or members) to leave the space. Do not put yourself in danger: if the situation requires it call the police. Criminal behaviour will not be tolerated. Restriction of access and termination of membership Membership of the Hackspace may be restricted or terminated by the board for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines as to behaviour likely to cause restriction or termination of membership: receiving three or more warnings from different sources within 6 months continuing with behaviour after you have been asked to stop a pattern of harassing behaviour, whether or not warnings have been issued a single serious or obviously intentional offence such as taking compromising photographs (e.g. up their skirt), punching or groping someone In the event of a serious accusation, the board reserves the right to suspend the accused\u2019s access to the Hackspace while investigations are carried out. Reporting inappropriate behaviour to the board Any member can take a report from someone who has received harassment and passes that information to the board. When taking a report from someone who has received harassment you should record faithfully what they say and reassure them that they are being taken seriously, however, you should avoid making specific promises regarding the actions of the board. Ask for information the reporter has not volunteered (such as time and place of incident(s)) but do not pressure them into giving details if they do not feel comfortable doing so. Even if the report lacks key details (such as the identity of the person engaging in the harassing behaviour) it should still be recorded and passed to the board. If the reporter desires it arrange for an escort by a trusted person, contact a friend or family member to come and support them and/or contact the local police. Do not pressure the reporter into taking any actions they do not wish to. Respect the reporters\u2019 privacy, do not discuss their report outside the reporting structure (don\u2019t break the code of conduct yourself). The report should include (as far as practicable): the identity of the perpetrator (name/nickname/description) time and date of the incident time and date the report was received (if different) the identity of the victim your identity the behaviour - this can be couched in general terms if the report requires it the circumstances surrounding the incident other people involved in the incident Any other information you think is pertinent Public statements As general rule members of Hackspace Manchester should avoid making public statements about the behaviour of individual people in relation to the code of conduct. The board will make as much detail about bans and current warnings as they feel appropriately available to all members. Summary If you have been asked to stop behaving in a certain way, do so. It\u2019s fine to ask what it is you\u2019re doing that is upsetting the person if it is not clear, but you shouldn\u2019t ask why the person is upset by it, it\u2019s enough that they are. If you have to take action to stop someone behaving in a way contrary to the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement do so, if possible consult with other members and/or the board, however, if action is required take it and explain later. Member\u2019s Storage Guidelines Member\u2019s Storage The Member\u2019s storage area is available for members to store projects they are currently working on along with raw materials. We have limited space, so please consider if something needs to be in the space before storing it. Each member is entitled to either a cube or half a shelf of storage in the member\u2019s storage area. Each storage cube is numbered and this space needs to be claimed on the member\u2019s system under the Member\u2019s Storage page. Your items must be completely contained within in a clearly labelled box. The label must state your full name or unique nickname and a way of contacting you e.g. Telegram username or email address. Labels must be visible. Stored Items Disposal Any unlabelled items found in member\u2019s storage will be put into the three-week boxes, starting in the \u201cBox Of Shame\u201d. If you do this please make sure you post a picture of the item on the mailing list at the same time. Any labelled oversized items left in member\u2019s storage will be moved to large project storage. Unlabelled large items in either of the storage areas will be moved to the \u2018free stuff\u2019 area, and may just vanish without warning! Items in large project storage with an expired \u201cDo Not Hack\u201d label will be moved directly to the \u2018free stuff\u2019 area, and may just vanish without warning! (You may contact the board or the mailing list if you are unable to come in to stop this happening.) Boxes 64L Really useful boxes fit exactly on half a blue shelf- The VUB30 from http://www.bigdug.co.uk/storage-boxes-containers-c363/value-plastic-storage-boxes-c98/wham-economy-plastic-boxes-with-clipon-lids-p1452 1 fits well in a storage cube (the space may stock these for sale to members at ~\u00a35 each) Large Projects If you\u2019re going to take up a lot of space with a project you must ask on the forum to get consensus from the membership for permission to store your items. It may help if you also link the post in the telegram chat. Oversized items must be stored in the large project storage area in the outer corridor, not in members storage. Oversized items need to be clearly labelled with a Do Not Hack sticker including your name / unique nickname, a method of contacting you and an estimated finish date. If you are going to overshoot this finish date, replace the Do Not Hack sticker with an updated estimate. Specific Material Storage Storage for specific classes of materials may be allocated within the space. These areas will be clearly marked and all materials stored within them must contain a DNH label showing the owner of the material. Group Storage Any group requiring the ability to store their projects in the space may request additional storage space by requesting the board (or a suitable subcommittee nominated by the board) assign the group a space. When making the request the requester must give the following information: The names of at least two space members who are members of the group. The nature of the group and its aims. If the group receives any outside funding. The nature of the articles to be stored. Any requested deviations from the standard conditions. If the board (or the subcommittee to which these powers are delegated) decide to grant the request for group storage, they will usually impose the following conditions, athough they may be varied at the request of the group. That the group contain at least 2 active members of the space. That the group meet at least 11 times in a year, and at each meeting at least two group members must be present, one of which must be a member of the space. This will be checked by requiring the group to fill out a sheet when they meet. The group must clearly label their box. The group will be limited to one member storage box, and may use large project storage as long as there is one nominated member who is the contact for the item stored. The group must nominate one active member of the space as a primary contact, and one other member of the group as a secondary contact. Should the group not meet the above requirements they have 30 days from being notified to either meet the requirements again (e.g. by finding a different space member to be part of the group), request a change of the conditions (days when this is being considered will not count towards the 30 days), or remove their box. After these 30 days the box may be removed and disposed of as the board see fit. Expiry of Membership If your membership expires through cancellation or unpaid membership fees your member\u2019s storage will remain in place for 60 days from the last payment date. After the 60 days, your box may be removed and placed on the shelves of shame. Things you MUST NOT store in the Hackspace Dangerous / Flammable Chemicals. Lithium batteries must be in a safe charging-bag Lithium charging bags are cheap. Food (except where it is in a sealed metal container) Radioactive Materials No live animals or perishable articles Donating/Loaning Items to the Space We regularly get people wishing to donate or loan items to the space, this can be something small like a length of cable right through to large tools and equipment like the lathe. Is the item useful? We ask that before you donate or loaning any item to the Hackspace, that you assess its usefulness to the Space and citizens of the space. The easiest way to do this is to ask. Use the telegram group or forum and see what people think. Where do I put the item? If the item already has a home e.g Electrical Wire, Glue, Screwdrivers then place your donated/loaned item in the appropriate box, shelf etc. Other items should be placed on the black shelves in the corridor and may at any point be used by members for projects or may be binned if they are no longer deemed useful. Loaned items will have their owner informed and asked to remove. Loaned items Conditions. Items on loan will remain the property of the member who owns them, these items should be labeled similar to a DNH label. Hackspace Manchester Board of Directors reserve the right to the ask any member who has loaned an item to the space to remove the item should it no longer be required. If a member who has loaned an item to the space ceases to be a member and does not remove the loaned item within 60 days (similar to Member\u2019s storage items) the loaned item will then be considered donated to the space and the future of the tool (maintenance, renewal, updating, usefulness etc) will be determined by the board or an appropriate subcommittee. Hackspace Manchester will not accept liability for any tools damaged whilst on loan to the space and whilst every care will be taken, mistakes and accidents happen. This post has been edited to included amendments to this document. The above is a final version as approved by the board on the 5th of February 2019. All members are now expected to abide by this updated Membership Agreement. Questions?

This includes but is not limited to: Making exclusionary jokes (even \u201cironically\u201d) Harassing or bullying of others (if you need to know what harassment covers see wikipedia ) Using language or engaging in activity that is homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, sexist or otherwise exclusionary. Engaging in any activity that involves others without all parties have given their consent (consent is defined as an informed, affirmative decision made freely and actively by all parties to engage in mutually acceptable activity). Making an assumption of others including (but not limited) any perceived gender, sexual orientation or religion. If you are unsure then we would rather you asked and apologise if you are mistaken, however, respect other people\u2019s privacy - they have the right not to answer any specific questions regarding their life. People\u2019s private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status. Don\u2019t judge - instead share your knowledge! Knowledge is not a competition - instead of judging people for what they don\u2019t know, help them. Elitism is not welcome in the space. When doing this, remember that different people have different approaches, and may not want your help. *Here at the Hackspace we make things, including mistakes! * Alcoholic drinks are permitted within the Hackspace however there should be no expectation or pressure on anyone to drink alcohol or conversely not to drink alcohol. No tools or equipment should be operated by anyone under the influence of alcohol (or other substances) Anyone who is obviously intoxicated will be asked to leave the space Respect other peoples belongings and space. If possible ask before moving other people\u2019s things. If a machine appears to be in use check if the person has finished before taking over. Don\u2019t spread your things too far and tidy up as you go along - others may be trying to work in the same area. If you\u2019re in the space on your own it\u2019s easy, and tempting, to spread out, be aware of others coming in and be prepared to stop working in order to create space for them. Follow the rules regarding storage and leaving projects out in the space. Don\u2019t mess around with other peoples\u2019 projects and possessions without their permission.

This basic rule is the guiding light of safety rules, and as such, we have adopted it as our foundation of our health and safety rules. Do not allow others to be on fire, or the space to be on fire.

Rules Wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) where required Information on what PPE is required can be found on the page for that tool in the members system (and hopefully soon on the tool itself) Sensible use is required - protect yourself. Complete inductions for tools that require them Some tools are dangerous, even if they don't seem so, and require an induction before you may use them. These are labelled. If you're not sure if a tool requires an induction, ask! Check the state of the equipment you're about to use. If it has a label saying \"Do Not Use\" then Do Not Use it! Does it appear to be in working order? Are any power cables damaged? Are all shields in place and secured? Does the emergency stop button work? Tag damaged or unsafe equipment out of use A piece of paper with \"Do Not Use\" is sufficient, with reason why Let others know by posting a topic on the forum. Clean up after finishing work. Remove all hazards for the next person wanting to use this tool. Considerations Your working area. Other members. Whether you really know how to use the equipment in a safe and sensible way. Wisdom Equipment can have quirks, certain ways of working, and some may be safer than others. All wisdom should be on the hackspace wiki tool pages. If you're unsure on how to use a tool, pleae ask.

It is a community. The infrastructure (building, equipment, tools, electric, internet etc) provides the foundations, and people working together with shared understandings and expectations are what provide a place of strong community. Every member is a citizen of the Hackspace Community and as such must follow the rules and guidelines in place to ensure that the community can exist safely and cohesively. The Citizen Hacman Commitment is what we expect from all Hackspace Citizens and explains how you can play your part in building, maintaining, and growing our community. Examples included in the Citizen Hacman Commitment are just that, this is not an exhaustive list of behaviours that may be considered in breach of the rules. As a Citizen of Hacman\u2026 I am committed to: Membership Conditions Hackspace Manchester is open to everyone over the age of 18 who registers at https://members.hacman.org.uk/register and pays a monthly subscription fee of at least \u00a310 per month. Rule 0 - DO NOT BE ON FIRE A hacker may not be on fire, cause a fellow hacker to be on fire, or through inaction allow a fellow hacker to be on fire. As a Hackspace Citizen it is essential that you act responsibly and safely within the Space this includes but is not limited to: Using appropriate PPE. Hackspace Manchester provides relevant PPE including goggles, breathing masks, gloves, hearing protection etc and these should be used where appropriate. Using tools safely - Tools and equipment that require an induction must not be used until you have been inducted on them. Tools that do not require an induction may be used and use of such tools will be taken as an acknowledgement that your comfortable using these tools. Reporting any accidents, near misses, and unsafe usage to the Hackspace Health & Safety subcommittee via the Hackspace Helpdesk Only using tools that have been identified as NOT SAFE FOR LONE WORKING when someone else is present in the Space. Rule 1: Be excellent to each other (follow the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement) A hacker should treat each and every other hacker with the respect we feel we deserve ourselves. We want our Hackspace to be somewhere that people can enjoy making things in a safe, harassment-free environment. Anybody who is in the Hackspace, attending an event as part of the Hackspace or is using any of the Hackspace communication channels (IRC, Mailing List or Telegram) is covered by the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement. Rule 2: Colour within the lines (and erase afterwards) A hacker should keep their belongings safe and tidy so that other hackers are not inconvenienced or injured by them. Follow the member\u2019s storage guidelines Don\u2019t spread your stuff all over the place. Be willing to make room for others to work when needed Tidy up any mess you make including tidying tools up and putting them back in the right places, disposing of rubbish appropriately If you can please try and spend a few minutes tidying up other people\u2019s mess (no one is perfect and someone may have left something out and by tidying it you\u2019re helping keep the space enjoyable for everyone) Rule 3: Appreciate the Space! A hacker should appreciate the space and that it is a shared space with other Hackspace Citizens . All Hackspace Citizens are asked to respect and appreciate the space including but not limited to: Tidying up after yourself Carrying out Housekeeping tasks such as taking the rubbish out, hoovering up, watering the plant etc) Reporting any broken/damaged tools or infrastructure via the Hackspace Helpdesk Promptly paying for snackspace, laser and other equipment fees Taking care not to damage tools or infrastructure Helping to improve the space by taking part in Hack the Space Days where possible or getting involved in the teams/subcommittees responsible for the running of the space. Getting involved with Space Bureaucracy through the Members Meetings and voting in the elections. Not borrowing/removing tools from the space or expecting tools to be available. We do not guarantee the uptime or availability of equipment. (No refunds will be given for membership just because a tool is out of use) Members may bring guests into the space but are responsible for the actions of the guests. Guests must not use any equipment that requires an induction and should not be left alone in the space. Ensuring you follow Access Control protocols including closing doors when leaving, not propping doors open unnecessarily and not giving others access to the space or space systems via your RFID fob, Login information or other authentication methods Comply with all relevant legislation including but not limited to: Following the principles of the Health and Safety at Work Act No Smoking (including vaping) within the Space No illegal activities e.g bringing stolen goods into the space No sleeping/living in the space You may use the hackspace to further your business objectives but keep in mind that this is a shared space and that you won\u2019t be given nor should you expect any priority or special treatment so please plan your deadlines accordingly. Rule 4: No Obligation Hackspace Manchester does not employ any staff. Volunteers give up their spare time to assist with inductions on equipment and to help keep the space running, therefore, please bear in mind the following: Equipment inductions are done by volunteers and there may be a wait for these Maintenance of tools and equipment is done by volunteers which means that it may take a while for tools to be fixed if damaged/out of service There is no obligation on Hackspace Manchester to purchase new tools and equipment. The majority of space tools were funded by member pledges so if you wish we had a tool or piece of equipment feel free to start a pledge on the Forum There is no obligation on you to remain a member, membership is monthly rolling and can be cancelled at anytime using the Member\u2019s system. Just because someone is in the space doesn\u2019t mean they are willing to induct you or fix something at that time Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement As a condition of my membership to Hackspace Manchester I agree to the following: To follow the rules and guidelines of Hackspace Manchester Hackspace Manchester is a safe and inclusive space, free from violence, harassment, hate speech or exclusionary behaviour. This includes but is not limited to: Making exclusionary jokes (even \u201cironically\u201d) Harassing or bullying of others (if you need to know what harassment covers see wikipedia ) Using language or engaging in activity that is homophobic, transphobic, racist, ableist, sexist or otherwise exclusionary. Engaging in any activity that involves others without all parties have given their consent (consent is defined as an informed, affirmative decision made freely and actively by all parties to engage in mutually acceptable activity). Making an assumption of others including (but not limited) any perceived gender, sexual orientation or religion. If you are unsure then we would rather you asked and apologise if you are mistaken, however, respect other people\u2019s privacy - they have the right not to answer any specific questions regarding their life. People\u2019s private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status. Don\u2019t judge - instead share your knowledge! Knowledge is not a competition - instead of judging people for what they don\u2019t know, help them. Elitism is not welcome in the space. When doing this, remember that different people have different approaches, and may not want your help. *Here at the Hackspace we make things, including mistakes! * Alcoholic drinks are permitted within the Hackspace however there should be no expectation or pressure on anyone to drink alcohol or conversely not to drink alcohol. No tools or equipment should be operated by anyone under the influence of alcohol (or other substances) Anyone who is obviously intoxicated will be asked to leave the space Respect other peoples belongings and space. If possible ask before moving other people\u2019s things. If a machine appears to be in use check if the person has finished before taking over. Don\u2019t spread your things too far and tidy up as you go along - others may be trying to work in the same area. If you\u2019re in the space on your own it\u2019s easy, and tempting, to spread out, be aware of others coming in and be prepared to stop working in order to create space for them. Follow the rules regarding storage and leaving projects out in the space. Don\u2019t mess around with other peoples\u2019 projects and possessions without their permission. Discussion of how to make our Hackspace more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this \u201chas gone too far\u201d aren\u2019t. If you have any concerns about someone\u2019s behaviour please let us know either in person or by emailing board@hacman.org.uk. If you do not wish to email the whole board, individual board members can be contacted via firstname@hacman.org.uk Consequences Warnings It is better to let someone know that their behaviour is liable to break the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement prior to it actually doing so than issue them with a warning. Any member can issue a warning to a person whose behaviour has broken the code of conduct. Warnings should be reported to board@hacman.org.uk as soon as practical. The report should include: identifying information (name/nickname/description) of the person the time and date the warning was issued the behaviour that was in violation the approximate time the behaviour occurred (if different to the warning) the circumstances surrounding the incident your identity other people involved in the incident Asking people to leave Non-members Any non-member who breaks the Code of Conduct can be asked to leave by any member, this includes non-members who are guests of members. Members If a board member is present they get to make a decision about whether one (or all) of the member(s) have to leave the space. If no board member is present any two or more members who have witnessed the incident(s) may ask the member (or members) to leave the space. Do not put yourself in danger: if the situation requires it call the police. Criminal behaviour will not be tolerated. Restriction of access and termination of membership Membership of the Hackspace may be restricted or terminated by the board for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines as to behaviour likely to cause restriction or termination of membership: receiving three or more warnings from different sources within 6 months continuing with behaviour after you have been asked to stop a pattern of harassing behaviour, whether or not warnings have been issued a single serious or obviously intentional offence such as taking compromising photographs (e.g. up their skirt), punching or groping someone In the event of a serious accusation, the board reserves the right to suspend the accused\u2019s access to the Hackspace while investigations are carried out. Reporting inappropriate behaviour to the board Any member can take a report from someone who has received harassment and passes that information to the board. When taking a report from someone who has received harassment you should record faithfully what they say and reassure them that they are being taken seriously, however, you should avoid making specific promises regarding the actions of the board. Ask for information the reporter has not volunteered (such as time and place of incident(s)) but do not pressure them into giving details if they do not feel comfortable doing so. Even if the report lacks key details (such as the identity of the person engaging in the harassing behaviour) it should still be recorded and passed to the board. If the reporter desires it arrange for an escort by a trusted person, contact a friend or family member to come and support them and/or contact the local police.

The board will make as much detail about bans and current warnings as they feel appropriately available to all members. Summary If you have been asked to stop behaving in a certain way, do so. It\u2019s fine to ask what it is you\u2019re doing that is upsetting the person if it is not clear, but you shouldn\u2019t ask why the person is upset by it, it\u2019s enough that they are. If you have to take action to stop someone behaving in a way contrary to the Citizen Hacman Membership Agreement do so, if possible consult with other members and/or the board, however, if action is required take it and explain later. Member\u2019s Storage Guidelines Member\u2019s Storage The Member\u2019s storage area is available for members to store projects they are currently working on along with raw materials. We have limited space, so please consider if something needs to be in the space before storing it. Each member is entitled to either a cube or half a shelf of storage in the member\u2019s storage area. Each storage cube is numbered and this space needs to be claimed on the member\u2019s system under the Member\u2019s Storage page. Your items must be completely contained within in a clearly labelled box. The label must state your full name or unique nickname and a way of contacting you e.g. Telegram username or email address. Labels must be visible. Stored Items Disposal Any unlabelled items found in member\u2019s storage will be put into the three-week boxes, starting in the \u201cBox Of Shame\u201d. If you do this please make sure you post a picture of the item on the mailing list at the same time. Any labelled oversized items left in member\u2019s storage will be moved to large project storage. Unlabelled large items in either of the storage areas will be moved to the \u2018free stuff\u2019 area, and may just vanish without warning! Items in large project storage with an expired \u201cDo Not Hack\u201d label will be moved directly to the \u2018free stuff\u2019 area, and may just vanish without warning! (You may contact the board or the mailing list if you are unable to come in to stop this happening.) Boxes 64L Really useful boxes fit exactly on half a blue shelf- The VUB30 from http://www.bigdug.co.uk/storage-boxes-containers-c363/value-plastic-storage-boxes-c98/wham-economy-plastic-boxes-with-clipon-lids-p1452 1 fits well in a storage cube (the space may stock these for sale to members at ~\u00a35 each) Large Projects If you\u2019re going to take up a lot of space with a project you must ask on the forum to get consensus from the membership for permission to store your items. It may help if you also link the post in the telegram chat. Oversized items must be stored in the large project storage area in the outer corridor, not in members storage. Oversized items need to be clearly labelled with a Do Not Hack sticker including your name / unique nickname, a method of contacting you and an estimated finish date. If you are going to overshoot this finish date, replace the Do Not Hack sticker with an updated estimate. Specific Material Storage Storage for specific classes of materials may be allocated within the space. These areas will be clearly marked and all materials stored within them must contain a DNH label showing the owner of the material. Group Storage Any group requiring the ability to store their projects in the space may request additional storage space by requesting the board (or a suitable subcommittee nominated by the board) assign the group a space. When making the request the requester must give the following information: The names of at least two space members who are members of the group. The nature of the group and its aims. If the group receives any outside funding. The nature of the articles to be stored. Any requested deviations from the standard conditions. If the board (or the subcommittee to which these powers are delegated) decide to grant the request for group storage, they will usually impose the following conditions, athough they may be varied at the request of the group. That the group contain at least 2 active members of the space. That the group meet at least 11 times in a year, and at each meeting at least two group members must be present, one of which must be a member of the space. This will be checked by requiring the group to fill out a sheet when they meet. The group must clearly label their box. The group will be limited to one member storage box, and may use large project storage as long as there is one nominated member who is the contact for the item stored. The group must nominate one active member of the space as a primary contact, and one other member of the group as a secondary contact. Should the group not meet the above requirements they have 30 days from being notified to either meet the requirements again (e.g. by finding a different space member to be part of the group), request a change of the conditions (days when this is being considered will not count towards the 30 days), or remove their box. After these 30 days the box may be removed and disposed of as the board see fit. Expiry of Membership If your membership expires through cancellation or unpaid membership fees your member\u2019s storage will remain in place for 60 days from the last payment date. After the 60 days, your box may be removed and placed on the shelves of shame. Things you MUST NOT store in the Hackspace Dangerous / Flammable Chemicals. Lithium batteries must be in a safe charging-bag Lithium charging bags are cheap. Food (except where it is in a sealed metal container) Radioactive Materials No live animals or perishable articles Donating/Loaning Items to the Space We regularly get people wishing to donate or loan items to the space, this can be something small like a length of cable right through to large tools and equipment like the lathe. Is the item useful? We ask that before you donate or loaning any item to the Hackspace, that you assess its usefulness to the Space and citizens of the space. The easiest way to do this is to ask. Use the telegram group or forum and see what people think. Where do I put the item? If the item already has a home e.g Electrical Wire, Glue, Screwdrivers then place your donated/loaned item in the appropriate box, shelf etc. Other items should be placed on the black shelves in the corridor and may at any point be used by members for projects or may be binned if they are no longer deemed useful. Loaned items will have their owner informed and asked to remove. Loaned items Conditions. Items on loan will remain the property of the member who owns them, these items should be labeled similar to a DNH label. Hackspace Manchester Board of Directors reserve the right to the ask any member who has loaned an item to the space to remove the item should it no longer be required. If a member who has loaned an item to the space ceases to be a member and does not remove the loaned item within 60 days (similar to Member\u2019s storage items) the loaned item will then be considered donated to the space and the future of the tool (maintenance, renewal, updating, usefulness etc) will be determined by the board or an appropriate subcommittee. Hackspace Manchester will not accept liability for any tools damaged whilst on loan to the space and whilst every care will be taken, mistakes and accidents happen. This post has been edited to included amendments to this document. The above is a final version as approved by the board on the 5th of February 2019. All members are now expected to abide by this updated Membership Agreement.","title":"Citizen Hacman Commitment"},{"location":"Membership/citizen_hacman_commitment/#citizen-hacman-commitment","text":"","title":"Citizen Hacman Commitment"},{"location":"Membership/citizen_hacman_commitment/#introduction","text":"Hackspace Manchester is something we do together.

The relevant functions are listed under the appropriate Sub-committee heading The Finance Sub-Committee (FSC); The Membership Sub-Committee (MSC); The Health & Safety Sub-Committee (HSSC); The Infrastructure Sub-Committee (ISC); The Outreach Sub-Committee (OSC). In accordance with the Articles of Association, the Board may add to, remove or amend any or all of those functions at any time. Meetings of all Sub-committees are open to all Members to attend and raise their views, whether or not they may sit as members of that Sub-committee though only members of the subcommittee may vote on decisions. Membership of each sub-committee will include by default 2 board members and at least 3 other members. Members can be nominated to subcommittees via election following the same rules as Board of Directors elections (if determined by the Board as the most appropriate way), self-nomination and approval from the board or by being co-opted by a sub-committee (see section 5) Each Sub-committee shall have the power to co-opt Members to serve as members of the Sub-Committee, provided that:- 5.1 such co-optees would not otherwise be excluded from serving as the Director of a Company under the terms of the Companies Acts; and 5.2 such co-optees are members of Hackspace Manchester; and 5.3 the names of all such co-optees are submitted to and approved by the Board of Directors following the meeting of the Committee at which the co-option took place. Such approval may be granted by email, telegram, telephone call or other means of communication. The Chair of each Sub-committee shall be decided upon annually by a simple majority vote of the membership of the subcommittee and formally approved by the Board. Membership of Sub-Committees is for a period of two years, Members may be reappointed to the subcommittee after this time.

Nowadays, HTTPS is a required feature for any website. Let\u2019s see how to: Setup a nginx reverse-proxy and generate a nginx config for each website to link a domain name and a container. Create and renew SSL certificates to enable HTTPS on each website. Prerequisites - Several websites run inside Docker containers on a single server. (Each one could either be a static files server, or Wordpress running on Apache or combination of a Node.js app and a reverse-proxy like in my previous article ). - The domain name for each website is configured to point to the IP of the server. The manual way to setup a nginx reverse-proxy is to install nginx directly on the host, or inside a Docker container, then fill-in each website configuration (probably in the sites-available / sites-enabled files) pointing to the exposed ports of the containers. The downsides to this approach are: The need to modify the nginx config every time a website is added or removed. The need to restart nginx after each config modification, causing a short downtime for every websites. The need to expose a port of each container to the host, and therefore keep track of the used ports (two containers can not use the same port). To avoid these downsides, the magic [**jwilder/nginx-proxy**](https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy) automates the creation of nginx configs and reloads the proxy server when a container starts and stops. And it has HTTPS support. Even better, the nginx-proxy has a [**LetsEncrypt companion**](https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion) , which allows the automatic creation and renewal of HTTPS certificates. In one word: set-it-and-forget-it. Project structure Create a nginx-proxy directory next to the websites directories. In my setup this is in /srv/www/ on the host. . +-- nginx-proxy | +-- docker-compose.yml | +-- nginx.tmpl | +-- conf.d | +-- vhost.d | +-- html | +-- certs +-- your-website-one.tld +-- your-website-two.tld +-- your-website-three.tld Inside /nginx-proxy , create four empty directories: conf.d , vhost.d , html and certs . These are used to store the nginx and the Let\u2019s Encrypt configuration files. docker-compose.yml Inside /nginx-proxy/ , create a docker-compose.yml file with this content: version: '3'services: nginx: image: nginx labels: com.github.jrcs.letsencrypt_nginx_proxy_companion.nginx_proxy: \"true\" container_name: nginx restart: unless-stopped ports: - \"80:80\" - \"443:443\" volumes: - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/vhost.d:/etc/nginx/vhost.d - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/html:/usr/share/nginx/html - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro nginx-gen: image: jwilder/docker-gen command: -notify-sighup nginx -watch -wait 5s:30s /etc/docker-gen/templates/nginx.tmpl /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf container_name: nginx-gen restart: unless-stopped volumes: - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/vhost.d:/etc/nginx/vhost.d - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/html:/usr/share/nginx/html - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:ro - /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/nginx.tmpl:/etc/docker-gen/templates/nginx.tmpl:ro nginx-letsencrypt: image: jrcs/letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion container_name: nginx-letsencrypt restart: unless-stopped volumes: - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/vhost.d:/etc/nginx/vhost.d - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/html:/usr/share/nginx/html - /srv/www/nginx-proxy/certs:/etc/nginx/certs:rw - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro environment: NGINX_DOCKER_GEN_CONTAINER: \"nginx-gen\" NGINX_PROXY_CONTAINER: \"nginx\"networks: default: external: name: nginx-proxy This will launch three services: nginx : the nginx-reverse proxy, uses the default nginx image. The label is needed so that the letsencrypt container knows which nginx proxy container to use. nginx-gen : uses the [jwilder/docker-gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen) image. Its command instruction will render a nginx configuration (based on nginx.tmpl ) for each website / container added to the network. nginx-letsencrypt : generates and renew the HTTPS certificates. All these services are bound to the nginx-proxy network. nginx.tmpl Inside /nginx-proxy/ , create a nginx.tmpl file and copy the content from this file . This is the used by the nginx-gen container to create the nginx configuration file for each website / container added to the network. Boot up First create the network: $ docker network create nginx-proxy Then create the reverse proxy with the nginx , nginx-gen and nginx-letsencrypt containers from the docker-compose.yml file: $ cd /srv/www/nginx-proxy/ $ docker-compose up -d Now the reverse-proxy is running. Link a website to the reverse-proxy To link a website to the running nginx-proxy, we need to update its own docker-compose.yml file ( not the one from nginx-proxy above) with a few instructions: 1. Environment variables services: my-app: \u2026 environment: VIRTUAL_HOST: your-website.tld VIRTUAL_PORT: 3000 LETSENCRYPT_HOST: your-website.tld LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL: your-email@domain.tld VIRTUAL_HOST : your domain name, used in the nginx configuration. VIRTUAL_PORT : (opt.) the port your website is listening to (default to 80 ). LETSENCRYPT_HOST : your domain name, used in the Let\u2019s Encrypt configuration. LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL : your email, used in the Let\u2019s Encrypt configuration. 2. Ports services: my-app: \u2026 expose: - 3000 Same as the VIRTUAL_PORT above. 3. Network networks: default: external: name: nginx-proxy Now lets start the website with: $ cd /srv/www/your-website.tld $ docker-compose up -d The website is automatically detected by the reverse proxy, has a HTTPS certificate and is visible at **https://your-website.tld** . Magic! Next Step How can we replicate this production environment, on a local dev computer? I wrote a follow up article about this: set a local web development environment with custom Urls and HTTPS . Useful links A complete guide to switching from HTTP to HTTPS : a very rich article explaining what HTTPS is technically, the different types of certificates and different ways to set it up on a server.

The iPad used in Mk.II has been removed and a 7\" TFT LCD screen has replaced it. In combination with a Raspberry Pi and a number of Teensy 2.0 microcontrollers, input can be taken from the buttons on the front of B-MO and run actions to show on the display (eg. pressing the green button will make B-MO say a positive response, while the red button will provide a negative response). In addition to this, two TowerPro SG90 servos will be used to move the arms on each side of B-MO, giving 90\u00b0 movement up and down when an action is given. The USB ports at the front allow for controllers to be plugged in and send inputs to the Raspberry Pi, such as directional inputs for playing a game. The Rasbperry Pi camera module will be connected to the Raspberry Pi and can take photographs on an action which is then saved to the internal storage for later uploading.

Our Hackspace is inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour. Do not make exclusionary jokes, even \"ironically\". Don\u2019t harass people. Physical contact or sexual attention without enthusiastic consent is harassment, or if taken to its extreme, abuse. Wearing revealing clothes or flirting are not necessarily consent. If you're asked to stop do so, if you're not sure the person is happy with what you are doing ask. Aggression and elitism are unwelcome - knowledge is not a competition. Although alcoholic drinks are allowed in the space, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol or conversely not to drink alcohol. However, those who are obviously intoxicated will be asked to leave the space. We\u2019d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise. Mistakes happen, however you should always use the person's preferred pronouns when addressing or discussing them. People's private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status. Respect other peoples belongings and space. If possible ask before moving people's things. If a machine appears to be in use check if the person has finished before taking over. Don't spread your things too far and tidy up as you go along - others may be trying to work in the same area. If you're in the space on your own it's easy, and tempting, to spread out, be aware of others coming in and be prepared to stop working in order to create space for them. Follow the bylaws regarding storage and leaving projects out in the space. Don't mess around with other peoples' projects and possessions without their permission. Discussion of how to make our Hackspace more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this \"has gone too far\" aren\u2019t. If you have any concerns about someone's behaviour please let us know either in person, or by emailing board@hacman.org.uk . If you do not wish to email the whole board, individual board members can be contacted via @hacman.org.uk Consequences Warnings It is better to let someone know that their behaviour is liable to break the code of conduct prior to it actually doing so than issue them with a warning . Any member can issue a warning to a person whose behaviour has broken the code of conduct. Warnings should be reported to board@hacman.org.uk as soon as practical. The report should include: identifying information (name/nickname/description) of the person the time and date the warning was issued the behaviour that was in violation the approximate time the behaviour occurred (if different to the warning) the circumstances surrounding the incident your identity other people involved in the incident Asking people to leave Non-members Any non-member who breaks the Code of Conduct can be asked to leave by any member, this includes non-members who are guests of members. Members If a board member is present they get to make a decision about whether one (or all) of the member(s) have to leave the space. If no board member is present any two or more members who have witnessed the incident(s) may ask the member (or members) to leave the space. Do not put yourself in danger: if the situation requires it call the police. Criminal behaviour will not be tolerated. Restriction of access and termination of membership Membership of the Hackspace may be restricted or terminated by the board for whatever reasons they deem sufficient. However, here are some general guidelines as to behaviour likely to cause restriction or termination of membership: receiving three or more warnings from different sources within 6 months continuing with behaviour after you have been asked to stop a pattern of harassing behaviour, whether or not warnings have been issued a single serious or obviously intentional offence such as taking compromising photographs (e.g. up their skirt), punching or groping someone In the event of a serious accusation the board reserves the right to suspend the accused's access to the Hackspace while investigations are carried out. Reporting inappropriate behaviour to the board Any member can take a report from someone who has received harassment and pass that information to the board. When taking a report from someone who has received harassment you should record faithfully what they say and reassure them that they are being taken seriously however, you should avoid making specific promises regarding the actions of the board. Ask for information the reporter has not volunteered (such as time and place of incident(s)) but do not pressure them into giving details if they do not feel comfortable doing so. Even if the report lacks key details (such as the identity of the person engaging in the harassing behaviour) it should still be recorded and passed to the board. If the reporter desires it arrange for an escort by a trusted person, contact a friend or family member to come and support them and/or contact the local police. Do not pressure the reporter into taking any actions they do not wish to. Respect the reporters' privacy, do not discuss their report outside the reporting structure (don't break the code of conduct yourself). The report should include (as far as practicable): the identity of the perpetrator (name/nickname/description) time and date of the incident time and date the report was received (if different) the identity of the victim your identity the behaviour - this can be couched in general terms if the report requires it the circumstances surrounding the incident other people involved in the incident Public statements As a general rule members of Manchester Hackspace should avoid making public statements about the behaviour of individual people in relation to the code of conduct. The board will make as much detail about bans and current warnings as they feel appropriate available to all members. This will usually be via the wiki. Summary If you have been asked to stop behaving in a certain way, do so. It's fine to ask what it is you're doing that is upsetting the person if it is not clear, but you shouldn't ask why the person is upset by it, it's enough that they are. If you have to take action to stop someone behaving in a way contrary to the Code of Conduct do so, if possible consult with other members and/or the board, however, if action is required take it and explain later.

Our Hackspace is inclusive; do not engage in homophobic, racist, transphobic, ableist, sexist, or otherwise exclusionary behaviour. Do not make exclusionary jokes, even \"ironically\". Don\u2019t harass people. Physical contact or sexual attention without enthusiastic consent is harassment, or if taken to its extreme, abuse. Wearing revealing clothes or flirting are not necessarily consent. If you're asked to stop do so, if you're not sure the person is happy with what you are doing ask. Aggression and elitism are unwelcome - knowledge is not a competition. Although alcoholic drinks are allowed in the space, there is no expectation or pressure to drink alcohol or conversely not to drink alcohol. However, those who are obviously intoxicated will be asked to leave the space. We\u2019d rather you ask about gender than assume, and if you get it wrong, apologise. Mistakes happen, however you should always use the person's preferred pronouns when addressing or discussing them. People's private lives are their own. Do not share details about others that they have not explicitly made public. This includes, but is not limited to, sexuality, gender, medical conditions, housing, relationship or financial status. Respect other peoples belongings and space. If possible ask before moving people's things. If a machine appears to be in use check if the person has finished before taking over. Don't spread your things too far and tidy up as you go along - others may be trying to work in the same area. If you're in the space on your own it's easy, and tempting, to spread out, be aware of others coming in and be prepared to stop working in order to create space for them. Follow the bylaws regarding storage and leaving projects out in the space. Don't mess around with other peoples' projects and possessions without their permission. Discussion of how to make our Hackspace more inclusive is welcome. Claims that this \"has gone too far\" aren\u2019t.

PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction and a Thermocycler is a device that cycles heat! In order to multiply DNA strands samples need to be heated to 95 degrees C, then cooled to 580 degrees C and then reheated to 78 degrees C. There are commercial PCR machines available but they are expensive! We think we can do better!! We are looking at realizing an arduino controlled Thermocycler with 4 modules (three heating sections and one cooling section) which automatically performs the heat cycling required on 16 DNA samples. The samples will be provided in test tubes or eppendorfs?? The device, once realised might look something like the attached diagram: For the control electronics an arduino Mega 2560 might be appropriate running on 5 Volts with a high current 12V 100W supply for the heater plate(s). The T0220 resistor can be controlled by a PWM fed N-type FET transistor. The control loop for the temperature cycle would be a feedback system based upon 0.5 second sampling of two 10k N-type thermistors; one mounted on the Al heating plate and the other on or near the sample carrier. The temperature of each plate can be displayed on a 16x2 LCD display. The unit will be controlled locally via push buttons and pre-stored temperature cycles or via a control program on a USB connected computer.

The input to the motor controllers is a 4-pin connector which carries power (direct battery connection) and a modified CAN bus called DXBUS. The joystick unit which plugs into it has an inductive joystick which is good quality. It produces a variable voltage between 0.7V-4.4V. The white and blue wires both produce the same voltage, for one axis, and the yellow and brown wires both represent the other axis. This plugs into a 7-pin connector on the control board in the joystick module. The pins, reading away from the joystick, are white, blue, brown, yellow, not connected, black (0V) and red (+5v). Resources The most comprehensive resource on the controller is a paper by Pedro Daniel Marques and Figueiredo Antao. Unfortunately for us it's in Portuguese: https://ria.ua.pt/bitstream/10773/5643/1/disserta%C3%A7%C3%A3o.pdf . I'll refer to this as the Portuguese document.

So, in the mbed compiler, can1.frequency(105263); . There are two DXBUS ports on the joystick unit so we can tap into the second one to monitor communications while the joystick unit is controlling the power unit. Note that you cannot observe the communication with the motors disconnected The list of CAN node IDs visible in this conversation are: 8, 64, 170, 700, 701, 668 and 669. It's possible though that 701 and 669 are single-bit errors caused by getting the clock rate wrong. 8 appears to be the power unit and everything else seems to come from the joystick unit. Node 64 (Joystick unit) 64 changes from a len 3 to a len 7 when the joystick is off centre. When centred it generally transmits [B0][01][20]. When moving forwards it shows: [B0][01][25][03][FC][02][19] The fifth and seventh (last) numbers are signed integers which represent the position of the joystick axis. The fifth integer is right (positive) and left (negative). The seventh is forward (positive) and backward (negative). By looking at the joystick position and data it appears that the acceleration limits are done by the joystick unit. The data on the CAN bus is already damped, so we may be able to bypass the acceleration limits by writing data to the CAN bus.

Other nodes 701 transmits [AA][04][20]. the last number rises to 25 when the motors are in motion, whichever direction they're going in. Simulating the Joystick unit We can't currently simulate the startup sequence necessary to completely replace the joystick unit. However, we can replace the joystick unit after startup, by quickly switching the can bus from the joystick to the MBED. We can't transmit from the MBED at the same time as the joystick unit as the joystick unit will still be transmitting different values for the joystick. Using a DPDT switch on the DXBUS and getting the MBED to transmit joystick position (the aforementioned [B0][01][25][03][FC][02][19] message) 20 times a second, the MBED can take over control of the motors. The switch could be replaced by a relay if we can't fully simulate the startup sequence. This also only works if the joystick is off-centre to start with - it won't work if the joystick is centred before the switch. There's probably some other initialisation sequence required. Non-CAN startup sequence On page 43 of the Portuguese document there's a diagram which shows something required for power-on which is not CAN standard. It appears to show a voltage of 7.5V and 12.4V being applied in a sequence that lasts about 50ms. It's not clear which CAN line this should be applied to or what it's relative to. Joystick unit thumb This is the flexible circuit connector from the Joystick's keypad. From left to right: 1 and 7 are internally connected and represent the power button 3 is the horn 4 is ground (connected to 0V out) Pressing the power button connects 1&7 to ground (4). Pressing the horn connects 3 to ground(4). The horn button connects to pin 23 on the 28-pin PDIP PIC on the side of the 7-segment display. The two power buttons connect to J2 and another pin next to it.

However, we can replace the joystick unit after startup, by quickly switching the can bus from the joystick to the MBED. We can't transmit from the MBED at the same time as the joystick unit as the joystick unit will still be transmitting different values for the joystick. Using a DPDT switch on the DXBUS and getting the MBED to transmit joystick position (the aforementioned [B0][01][25][03][FC][02][19] message) 20 times a second, the MBED can take over control of the motors. The switch could be replaced by a relay if we can't fully simulate the startup sequence. This also only works if the joystick is off-centre to start with - it won't work if the joystick is centred before the switch. There's probably some other initialisation sequence required.","title":"Simulating the Joystick unit"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Dynamic_controls_motor_controller/#non-can-startup-sequence","text":"On page 43 of the Portuguese document there's a diagram which shows something required for power-on which is not CAN standard.

There are six candidates standing, the election will run for two weeks from 00:01 on Tuesday 7th November until 23:59 on Monday 20th November. The election is performed using Meek STV, and you should have received an email from OpaVote as our agent for the election processing. You may rank any number of candidates, along with the No Further Places(NFP) candidate, if NFP is elected, no more candidates will be elected to fill any remaining slots. You are not required to rank all candidates. Candidates Every candidate was asked to provide a short hust limited to 512 characters, theses are displayed below. Candidates were also given the oppertunity to provide a photo, but as more than half declined, in the interest of fairness I have excluded them all. Chris Ball I am a longstanding member of the hackspace, and I have an adjacent workshop. I have always been enthusiastic about the hackspace community and it's ideals. I'm hoping that I can provide a good conduit for the community's wishes, while focusing on improved amenities and more varied consumables. Chris Hilliard Hi, I'm Chris, or badspyro on telegram. For the past two years, I've been one of your board members. I've been in charge of things like snackspace, consumeables, and have worked to stock things like laser materials and more for sale to members. I want to continue to improve the facilities for the space and what is availible for members. Most of all, I hope to help keep the space up and running for a long time into the future. Gregory Morris As an active member and contributor to the space, I feel that there are some processes that are not as efficient or streamlined as I would like - new member on-boarding and training are good examples. I believe that, if elected to the board, I would be able to improve these processes, allowing people to get on with their projects instead of waiting for membership systems to update or having to ask around to find out who can provide training. Conor Riches Hey, I'm Conor and I'd like to be on the Hacman board. I want to actively get things done with the aim of enabling the community to be the best hackerspace possible for the members. I'm passionate about the space and community and want to see it thrive while retaining the friendly, accepting and welcoming nature that makes it so great. Daniel Silverstone I readily admit that I am not the most well versed in the full activity of the space, however should you elect me to the board, my aim will be to be as unobtrusive as possible in the role, while doing my best to facilitate the smooth running of the space. The scope of the role is reduced with the increase in the member teams, and the MMMM, and as such I may focus more toward my interests of policy and software. I believe I would be suited to help with the MCP and with Haccess as and when it comes ready. Ross Stevenson I am Ross, I joined the space about 4 months ago and instantly felt at home and feel that I would like to take on more responsibility within the space and help with \"keeping the lights on\" I think the way forward with the teams handling a lot of the work of running the space is a fantastic way to operate and would continue to champion this as a board member.

I want to have more responsibility to the space and be able to help members in a greater variety of ways as well as introducing new people to what we have to offer. Anything form organizing events to dealing with issues (both minor and serious) is my cup of tea. Health and safety is also important to me so I often check that things in the space are done safely. I have the time and the passion to dedicate to the hackspace, liaising with members, the board and also with Landlords/trades etc. I am jumping at the chance to be able to be of guidance to all members, both new and old while being the \u201cprofessional face\u201d of the hackspace.

The user will come up to a device they want to use and press the green button. If the device needs RFID, it will ask for it to be scanned, if not it turns on. Each press of the green button while authenticated adds 30 minutes to the timer, so you go to the bench, press green twice for an hour. If its getting close to the end of the timer, the beeper starts beeping, and the user can press it again for another 30 minutes. Ideally, the HACCESS nodes would also let us mark people as trained.

A meeting was held on 25th of June 2009 in the Grey Horse Pub, Reddish, and Stockport Hackspace was formed, planning to rent a space in nearby Broadstone Mill. After some encouraging initial meetings with the architect at Broadstone, the Property Managers got involved, and the price skyrocketed out of the group's reach. The group then spent several months meeting in pubs around Stockport, looking for alternative affordable spaces, and discussing everything from Arduinos , to which OS is best ( Linux ). In late 2009, the group were contacted by a member of MCC , asking if they wanted to use a room in MCC's new HQ, Factory 2010, a building just inside the Mancunian Way. They decided to pursue this idea, and voted to move future meetings into Manchester City Centre, and rebrand. HACMan The group's name changed to Hacking & Artistic Community, Manchester (or HACMan) in late December/early January 2010, and the meetings moved nearer to the centre of Manchester, namely to The Bull's Head Pub. Unfortunately, in February 2010 MCC were forced to cancel the Factory 2010 project, leaving HACMan again without a space. However, the move into Manchester had opened up the door for more collaboration between HACMan and other groups in Manchester, and as of late February 2010 the group had started working closely with MadLab in the Northern Quarter. By July 2010, hacman were meeting every Wednesday and on the third Saturday monthly at Madlab. Hackspace Manchester In June 2012, due to time and space constraints, we decided it was time to move on from Madlab. We found another space just down the road at #44 Edge Street, and took occupancy as of the beginning of August 2012.

It has a 1/2hp 370w motor, and is commonly fitted with a 14TPI blade. CBS45M Manual Status The bandsaw is now operational. There are however some additional things we can do under the TODO list For induction see Team:Metal Use Rules for Use DO NOT press down on the top of the saw while cutting, it will take a while. We can't risk burning out the motor again after it cost 90 quids. DO NOT leave the motor unattended, it is tempting because the saw takes a while to get through steel, however if the motor catches / can't move then there's a risk again of damage to the motor. DO NOT use the saw for cutting wood. Generally it's okay to block up the metal part being cut with a small block of wood underneath. Just try to avoid cutting any wood with it. Tips I've found it's best to block up the metal part being cut underneath with a small block of wood. The saw will stop once it hits the red stop button and goes all the way down so it's best to raise the part up slightly. Try to use some cutting fluid to help cutting, use a bucket underneath to catch the oil Maintenance Motor The original motor was a 500W model which seemed to be used on the older versions of this bandsaw. This motor however had burnt out and had to be replaced. The motor has recently been replaced with a 1/2HP, 370W, 1400RPM motor which is the one Clarkes have in stock for this model of saw. All newer models seem to use this type of motor. Replacement motors are around \u00a390 with delivery and include the starting capacitor on the side. Mechanical Mechanically, the bandsaw appears to be in good condition - bearings have all been replaced and wheels realigned before we bought it. All bits for the bandsaw are located within a small blue square box with a lid, and metal bandsaw written on the top The bolt that fed into the tension adjuster had been bent, this has been replaced with some threaded rod. The On / Off Switch has been replaced (this cost around \u00a317 from clarkes) TODO spares I Think I've managed to identify which spares we're missing for the saw Stand Shelf / 7 / SD45007 I think this is the tool tray which keeps the frame rigid and acts as a drip tray Vertical Cutting Plate / 55 / SD45055 This is the plate used for cutting vertically Support Bracket / 102 / SD45056 This is a bracket that holds up the cutting plate Drip Tray There should be a shelf underneath the saw which is labeled on the manual as a tool shelf. This shelf is currently missing. Instead of replacing the shelf with an official one, instead we plan on replacing it with a water proof one that extends past the point of where the cut is being done to be used as a drip tray. As well as acting as a drip tray this will also help prevent the legs from spreading out when moving the machine on the wheels.

We have a small etch tank and all of the equipment available at HacMan for your PCB making needs! If you would like a tutorial please ask Alex for a demonstration\u2026 Let the instruction begin! To make a PCB you will need to obtain the following items: 1x piece of copper clad FR4 PCB material It needs to be slightly larger than the total area of the design you intend to make. Single and double sided FR4 PCB material is available in the PCB equipment box which is next to the electronics bench in the \u2018great wall of storage\u2019. If there is nothing of suitable size for your design you will have to buy your own PCB material. PCB.jpg Some glossy paper for transferring the design - 120 GSM glossy paper, matt one side, smooth on the other \u2013 This is available in the stationery draw in the main part of the space next to the boxes of shame and the craft making kit. Grab an A4 sheet and prepare the laser printer. Make sure no one is printing before you press print! A clothes iron or a plastic film laminator - There is an iron and a laminator in the PCB equipment box. Either can be used to transfer the toner from the glossy paper to the FR4 PCB material Iron.jpg The etch tank! \u2013 This is available on the \u2018great wall of storage\u2019 at the end next to the electronics page. Carry it over to a free space in the workshop. It will need to be near an electrical socket. Please be careful and try not to spill the etch fluid. You will also need to grab the air pump. Tank.jpg Finally some latex or rubber gloves, some eye protection goggles a lab coat or work clothes and some plastic tweezers - These should all be available in the PPE box in the great wall of storage of in the PCB making equipment box. Once you have obtained all of these things the process can begin...Exciting times! 1. Load a laser printer (it has to be a laser printer) with 120 GSM glossy paper. Make sure the smooth side is the side that is presented to the toner ink. Print out the PCB layout with only the tracks, pads and dimensions present. Most people in the space use EagleCad to develop their PCBS. It doesn't matter which software you use - Be sure the printout is mirrored before you begin. Remove any excess paper after printing using scissors. These are available in the knives box next to the boxes of shame on the 'great wall of storage' and ready for transfer.jpg 2. Once you have the printout on glossy paper its time to get hold of the blank copper clad PCB material. Cut it to size using the bandsaw or the PCB guillotine. I prefer to use the bandsaw. Clean the copper using a polishing block or pencil eraser. The copper area needs to be cleaned to remove any excess dirt or grease. At this point I wear plastic or latex gloves to prevent finger prints. You could also use wire wool - the process is to remove any dirt, grease and oxidation from the surface of the copper. 3. Heat up the clothes iron to as hot as possible - make sure there is no water in the iron (if its a steam iron). Place the printed PCB layout toner side down onto the cleaned copper side of the PCB. If needed secure the printout in place using masking tape or box clips. I use an old piece of wood to press down on when I iron on the design. The heat causes the toner to transfer from the paper onto the PCB; About 5 minutes of ironing should see the design properly transferred. Practice makes perfect! 4. Once you are happy the design has been transferred turn off the iron and place the PCB into some cold tap water. Be aware the PCB is probably quite hot so use suitable heat protective gloves or tongs! You could just leave the PCB to cool but I'm impatient! Next soak the paper off the PCB exposing just the ink and the copper. I like to use an old toothbrush to clean off the excess paper. paper rubbed off.jpg 5. Once complete inspect your transfer. You should be able to read any text present and there should be no broken tracks. If there are broken tracks you can touch them up using an acid resistant marker pen like the permanent markers used for writing on acetate sheets. If the design didn't transfer well at all you can clean off the toner and repeat the process from step 3 onwards. Again practice makes perfect and this is why I prefer the toner transfer method. I can rectify mistakes early on. 6. Now it's time to etch the PCB using the ferric chloride. Place the PCB in the etch tank with the design facing up! Gently rock and agitate the etchant for about ten minutes. Using plastic tweezers or taking care roll the etch tank to one side so that you can see the design. See if the uncovered copper has been removed. If it hasn't continue agitating the solution until it has been completely removed. 7. Once all of the uncovered copper has been removed take the PCB out of the etch tank and clean the PCB in tap water. Once all of the ferric chloride has been removed, clean off the black toner using wire wool or something suitably abrasive. You should be left with something similar to the picture below. After that it's time to drill any holes required using the dremel and the correct drill bit sizes before populating your PCB with components and soldering it up. Hopefully if it was designed properly it will perform the function you require! and drilled.jpg","title":"How to pcb"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/IRC_URLs/","text":"This page contains a log of URLs

Before getting wind of the closure we had blagged the keys to allow us to do collaborative projects on a Thursday evening. Though a condition of use of the FabLab no one actually documented their projects and if they were documented they may not necessarily appear on the FabLab web site. So we started to document projects using cameras. The intention to show that some useful work did go on. To get the full story we used three cameras and recorded the sound. This required three memory cards with space three lots of charged batteries, then removal of the cards copy to a machine then use a video editor to stick them all together. Not simple enough. The challenge was to make a four camera TV studio as easy to use as a smartphone. Also no that is Zero post production is a requirement as people (err me) are just too lazy to edit shite later. Components Used The studio is made up of the following parts: CAMERAS Four 1080p cameras, these are ethernet security cameras from hlong see alliexpress at about \u00a325 each they are good value, and not a bad image. They use a combination of two chips The Sony IMX322 and the Hi Hi3516C, though improved versions may exist now. The technical specs are irrelevant the purchase decision was made by a couple of pigeons. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JB8-RWIe30 1080p ethernet camera This is the vital string to put in the obs studio to make it all sing. ? NETWORKING Though the cameras are 100Mb ethernet with four to be connected to a PC with a 1Gb netcard it seemed sensible to use a 1Gb ethernet switch. GS305 Switch It was found that taking the cameras through multiple cascaded switches increases the delay and as we can see later having a predictable delay is important for sound sync. Fortuanately the switch has an L'Shaped PCB which fits nicely in the 50mm trunking used as the case. LIGHTING Four lighting panels were constructed using these LED chains. These were purchased from that auction site for \u00a312 in total giving 120 cool white LEDS maybe a mistake as they taint the video blue but more on that later. Chain SOUND Though the cameras have microphones the quality is poor so I had Belkin tunestudio which is easy to use and had a burr brown adc which is more than acceptable TuneStudio I struggled with the sound as I first purchased a couple of cheap shotgun mics, I think these really should be used in open spaces. I had a couple of Audio Technica boundary Pro 44 which I picked up for \u00a325 each and they are really not bad. They are omni directional enough for use. Technica Mic CONTROL UNIT As someone who stopped playing video games after they fixed the bug on the pub space invaders machines that allowed free play, it was not immediately obvious that on of the game thingys does a fine job to switch between cameras Controller SOFTWARE Though I think the use of computers for games (and indeed all games) are just for normal folk, I am mighty glad that I invoke the prime directive and let them get on with it. That way I can get all nice things like graphics cards and cherry keyboards and RAT mice, so I do follow what the gaming community get up to. They seem intent on not just playing but watching other play games as well, this means that some bright programmers have knitted together just the tool we need. https://obsproject.com/ Though I really hate proprietary software (Brittain's Law \"If it has a licence key you are using the wrong software\") I can see that some of what you pay for is better than some of the FOSS dross I am just payment averse, well in this case this is top notch fresh meat. It does everything required and what is more is cross platform and is absolutely free non of this cut down free version with missing pay for features. What Next This will appear at Hacman with a HIP sticker (Hack in Progress) what that means is I am hacking it and anyone else is welcome to collaborate on it with me. These are the challenges LIGHTING -Blue tint on recording from LEDs, in fact the CCTV cameras don't need the lighting much of the time so this is not such an issue, however two things solve this, OBS has real time filters so it will allow changing the colors. Also some form of diffusion would be beneficial. A side or uplight may be a good addition. SOUND SYNC - The delay from the cameras is fairly consistent so adding a delay into the OBS studio get round a lot of these issues, but more work needs to be done. CAMERA JITTER - The image after 15 minutes goes pair shaped, I have some mini fans which solve this. CASE DISTORTION - It bends have produced some more parts that need fitting STAND - I have a clothes stand which does work but a better job can be done. Improvements Fixing the challenges is all that will be done on this version as we need to start using the devices for maker propaganda. Version 2 can be started later.","title":"Instant TV studio"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/Instant_TV_studio/#why","text":"This came about from the death of Fab Lab Manchester.

For information on using the Laser Cutter, please see Laser Cutter The laser cutter is a K40-III from china. This model is also known as the blue horror, mainly due to the electronics and software used to drive it. It contains a 40W laser tube, which is powered at 20ma, at 25000V, and has an A4 bed size. Project Aim Rebuild a cheap chinese laser cutter to add functionality only found in more expensive machines. Project Members parag0n Project Status Replace bed with honeycomb bed, increasing bed size from 200 x 150 to A4 - COMPLETE Replace electronics with LAOS board - COMPLETE Configure for printing from visicut - COMPLETE Add webcam for visicut Automate extraction Automate & monitor cooling Add aiming dot Add air assist The Laser Cutter was originally a DC-K40III, purchased from eBay. These lasers are designed to cut up to A4-ish size, but are fairly simplistic. Electronics The mainboard that comes with the K40 is fairly crap. Its designed to use a piece of software called moshidraw, which is infuriatingly crap. I ripped mine out, and bought a LAOS board. The LAOS (LAser OpenSource) is a full control board for laser cutters. It is based on the MBed, connects to the network, and provides a fully open stack for laser cutting. This allows us to install the control software on anyone's PC / laptop, So they can configure the cutting from home, then click 'execute' when they get to the space. When I did my conversion, I had to make an adaptor from the ribbon cable used to connect the X axis motor and endstops to the JST connectors on the mainboard. Since v0.4, LAOS has this connector onboard, so the ribbon cable can just be plugged straight in. (photo) To connect the laser itself, only two lines are needed, one to the 'laser fire' header, and the other to replace the potentiometer for power level. The way LAOS recommend to do the PWM is fucking dangerous for the K40, as they install a pullup on the 5V line, meaning if the cutter is powered and the LAOS board isnt, the laser is on. I instead attached a pull down to ground, and flipped the laser PWM in the config file. (photo) I left the original 'laser enable' button on the cutter active, as its handy to be able to disable the laser. Bed As the laser is sold as an engraver, the bed as it arrives is a clamp, designed to hold a part in the middle of the bed. This is pretty crap for our use, so I replaced the bed with honeycomb. The stuff I used is 3mm x 10mm aluminium, used for carbon fibre composites. I will probably change it to 6mm x 15mm on the next bed replacement, as it is cheaper, and the thickness should help with warping. To do the actual replacement, I built the bed out of aluminium U channel, bolted together with L fixing plates in the corner. The honeycomb fits within this. I made some brass standoffs that fit in the existing mounting holes for the old bed, and mounted more U channel going cross-ways with springs to adjust the bed height. (photo) I also removed the exhaust port that sits above the bed, and chopped the front 2cm off it. By default the laser is able to cut the front bit of the exhaust port, not exactly what we want! This increases the size of the bed to a nice flat 300mm x 200mm Water Cooling I bought some 25L Containers of RO water for the cooling loop. Originally I bought a submersible caravan pump, but this died fairly quickly as it wasnt rated for continuous operation. I replaced it with a fairly oversized pump which works well, though it is LOUD. As the pump runs off 12V, I installed a secondary 12V 5A power supply in the electronics bay. This is powered on with the rest of the laser, and directly powers the lighting and the pump Extraction The extraction fan that comes with the laser is super shoddy, has a US plug, and a power lead so thin, you'll be amazed any electrons can actually fit down there. I replaced it with an inline model , and gutted the original fan unit to use it as an adaptor from the hole on the back of the cutter to 100mm tubing. Window + Lighting I replaced the original orange perspex window with a clear perspex one. It is exactly as effective at blocking IR, but means people can see better what is happening. I also added LED strip to the inside of the lid. This is wired directly to the 12v power supply, and helps the user see what is happening. Safety The Cutter doesn't have anything stopping the laser being on with the lid open. Eek. Wire a microswitch inline with the laser enable button to turn off the laser when the lid is open. (I still need to do this) Air Assist This is a thing that definitely helps a lot. Cutting Ply and MDF without it results in a lot of smoke and flames, since fitting the AA we've barely had any. I used a HAILEA ACO-318 Air Pump as the compressor for this. I bought a replacement head from LightObject . Handily the screw threads for this matched perfectly with the existing head, so I was able to just fit the lens holder and air assist nozzle without replacing the whole head. I bought some 7mm cable chain, ran my 6mm ID silicon tubing through it, and screwed it onto one of the existing screws for the laser head. I then ziptied the other end to the right hand side of the X axis. I also removed the top middle screw that holds the window in place with an angle grinder, as the chain was getting caught up on it.

Its designed to use a piece of software called moshidraw, which is infuriatingly crap. I ripped mine out, and bought a LAOS board. The LAOS (LAser OpenSource) is a full control board for laser cutters. It is based on the MBed, connects to the network, and provides a fully open stack for laser cutting. This allows us to install the control software on anyone's PC / laptop, So they can configure the cutting from home, then click 'execute' when they get to the space. When I did my conversion, I had to make an adaptor from the ribbon cable used to connect the X axis motor and endstops to the JST connectors on the mainboard. Since v0.4, LAOS has this connector onboard, so the ribbon cable can just be plugged straight in. (photo) To connect the laser itself, only two lines are needed, one to the 'laser fire' header, and the other to replace the potentiometer for power level. The way LAOS recommend to do the PWM is fucking dangerous for the K40, as they install a pullup on the 5V line, meaning if the cutter is powered and the LAOS board isnt, the laser is on. I instead attached a pull down to ground, and flipped the laser PWM in the config file. (photo) I left the original 'laser enable' button on the cutter active, as its handy to be able to disable the laser.","title":"Electronics"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/K40-III/#bed","text":"As the laser is sold as an engraver, the bed as it arrives is a clamp, designed to hold a part in the middle of the bed. This is pretty crap for our use, so I replaced the bed with honeycomb. The stuff I used is 3mm x 10mm aluminium, used for carbon fibre composites. I will probably change it to 6mm x 15mm on the next bed replacement, as it is cheaper, and the thickness should help with warping. To do the actual replacement, I built the bed out of aluminium U channel, bolted together with L fixing plates in the corner. The honeycomb fits within this. I made some brass standoffs that fit in the existing mounting holes for the old bed, and mounted more U channel going cross-ways with springs to adjust the bed height. (photo) I also removed the exhaust port that sits above the bed, and chopped the front 2cm off it. By default the laser is able to cut the front bit of the exhaust port, not exactly what we want! This increases the size of the bed to a nice flat 300mm x 200mm","title":"Bed"},{"location":"old_wiki_files/K40-III/#water-cooling","text":"I bought some 25L Containers of RO water for the cooling loop.

Book an induction (members only - sorry). Informational If the laser cutter does anything out of the ordinary please make sure it's reported to a laser maintainer. If the response is \"please put the out of order sign on the cutter\" then do that. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIX THE CUTTER YOURSELF. If it is clearly not functioning, put the out of order sign on it and then report it. We will fix it as soon as possible. Basic Information The cutting area is 600 x 400 mm (A2) You can cut material up to around 6mm thick Make sure the pump and cooler are running before using the laser! If you can't hear or feel the vibration of the pump, don't use the cutter. Some people (everyone bar Bob) have been having problems with red and black. If you're trying to do something intricate such as engraving we recommend NOT using black ANYWHERE on your design to avoid bits being engraved unnecessarily and wasting your time/money or potentially wrecking your design. Getting started In order to create your first design, you should install one of the following: Inkscape recommended Adobe Illustrator OpenSCAD Whatever you're using, it's recommended to install Inkscape as that can be used to tweak designs prior to importing them for cutting or etching. Inkscape Suggested Page Layout I like to use a 600mm x 400mm page, set to millimeters, with a 1mm grid. Media:Laser_Template.svg Is a good template. Just put it in the templates directory in your inkscape folder to use it. (Linux: .config/inkscape/templates/) Different Cuts / Colours Each different colour, line thickness, layer and group can be selected to cut differently, and the cut order changed. I normally use solid background colours in my inkscape designs to denote what should be cut and when. Visicut Visicut is used to convert files into the format needed to drive the laser cutter. Install visicut from http://hci.rwth-aachen.de/visicut-download (If you are using a mac the cross-platform Java implementation works best.)

This release allows the user to add tags to a DB, and remove them as needed (although with certain limitations...), and will unlock ONLY for those RFID tags in the Database. Version 0-3 This version will extend the functionality to include a Keypad for inputting a Pin. For this, the DB functions will have to be re-written, aswell as several other functions to allow a seperate Pin for each RFID tag. (This'l teach me for defining things explicitly....) This release will (hopefully) also address the limitations of Version 0-2, with a De-frag function for the database, as well as a password for the menu system.

Glass sheet must be 200 * 200 size Idealy using Borosilicate Glass that is around 3mm thickness Must be bought in a batch and cut from the same sheet to ensure we have multiple surfaces that are exacvtly the same thickness 3D printer will be out of action until calibrated for the new glass surfaces Printing How to print Place 3D object onto the Cura platform, rotate and scale it however you need. You can place multiple items on the bed if you need to print multiple things. It's a good idea to leave a few millimetres gap around the edge of the platform, just in case. Check the above settings and profile are loaded into Cura. If you're happy with the print time and amount of filament it'll use, export the toolpath to a location on your computer. Browse to either http://mendel90/ or http://m90.hacman.org.uk/ in your browser and log in to Octoprint using the details provided next to the printer itself. Load the .gcode toolpath file. Clear the printing bed of any other items. Click print ! Make sure you watch your print for a good duration at the start so you can stop any problems that happen, such as the filament not sticking to the heated bed. You can also watch your print using the control tab in Octoprint. Stopping a print Hit the stop button in Octoprint. Under the control tab, hit the home buttons under both the X/Y and Z columns. Recover your print from the bed.

Hardware I bought a clock from a pound shop, and removed the clock-module. I took it apart, and discovered that it seems to work by sending pulses through a coil which alternate in polarity every other second. Since the clock will only be moving forwards, and usually only by 15-60 minutes at a time, I tried just driving the clock as fast as possible. Connecting the two pins to an Arduino, I managed to increase the rotation speed so that one hour passes in 36-odd seconds. This is still a bit slow - if your next train is in an hour, you don't want to stand for 30 seconds before the clock displays this properly. I've decided to make a new pair of hands, and treat the second hand as a minute hand, and the minute hand as an hour hand, so I can drive them 60x faster. Unfortunately, I can't work out how the original circuit made sure that the movement was clockwise. Currently, the direction it sets off in seems fairly random! :S Software Currently very basic. Created a \"tick\" function to advance by one second, which energizes the coil with a polarity which depends on whether it's an odd or even second. Present Status I've recently acquired a more expensive clock module. Hopefully this will be more consistent. I need to take it apart and investigate.

Step 4. Save the damn design! Once you've got a design you're happy with, save it to disk before moving on. Step 5. Compile, render and export. Now it's time to compile that so that we can export the DXF. You can do this by: Hitting F6 Using the menu Design -> Compile and Render (GCAL) Now we can select Design -> Export as DXF. Select a sensible file name in a location you'll remember. That's our OpenSCAD work done.

It's a complex piece of equipment, and as such, it requires an induction. The manual, unlike that of the sewing machines, is less 'suggested reading' and more of a requirement to use the machine correctly and get the best results. While this machine is relatively robust, we advise against working on it with seriously heavy materials - you're likely to break the needles at minimum, and be forced to re-thread the machine, which is a non-trivial task. Forcing through overly heavy fabric can break the machine entirely too, as can too many layers of fabric. While it may not give as good a finish, we suggest the use of our Singer 4423 Heavy Duty Sewing machine instead.

PCR stands for Polymerase Chain Reaction and a Thermocycler is a device that cycles heat! In order to multiply DNA strands samples need to be heated to 950C, then cooled to 580C and then reheated to 780C. There are commercial PCR machines available but they are expensive! We think we can do better!! We are looking at realizing an arduino controlled Thermocycler with 4 modules (three heating sections and one cooling section) which automatically performs the heat cycling required on 16 DNA samples. The samples will be provided in test tubes or eppendorfs?? The device, once realised might look something like the attached diagram: For the control electronics an arduino Mega 2560 might be appropriate running on 5 Volts with a high current 12V 100W supply for the heater plate(s). The T0220 resistor can be controlled by a PWM fed N-type FET transistor. The control loop for the temperature cycle would be a feedback system based upon 0.5 second sampling of two 10k N-type thermistors; one mounted on the Al heating plate and the other on or near the sample carrier. The temperature of each plate can be displayed on a 16x2 LCD display. The unit will be controlled locally via push buttons and pre-stored temperature cycles or via a control program on a USB connected computer.

Gavan Fantom of LHS has also offered input. This is a plan for a cheap dot-matrix display using coloured ping-pong balls inside clear plastic tubes. The design could be adapted for different balls. We intend to create a prototype using smaller balls, possibly coloured beads, as a prototype. Display section Balls feed into the right hand side of the unit, one column at a time. They need to be ordered when they are fed in - we will describe how that is done later. When the full column is fed in, an actuator pushes the whole column into the tubes. To stop ping pong balls falling out while loading a column, there's another plate controlled by an actuator which will block off the end of the tubes until the column is fully loaded into the pusher. At the other end of the tubes, a single column fills up with ping pong balls as the input column is pushed in. This column is movable by another actuator; once the input procedure has completed it will pull back and the row of balls will fall either sideways or down (There should be some vertical space below the output position, so the bottom row can fall out correctly). The unsorted balls then fall down into a sorting machine. The sequence for the main display then is: Blanking plate back (uncovered) Output actuator forward (Leaving column space) Input actuator forward (shifting all balls into place) Blanking plate forward (covered) Output actuator backwards (dropping balls out of machine) Input actuator back. 4&5 can be simultaneous. After this is completed, the machine waits for the input column to be filled again, and the process repeats (it should wait for a signal from a microprocessor though, as the display may not be scrolling continuously). Sorting section This starts with a hopper or ramp which collects balls from the output column and guides them into a single output row. This may require a 'knocker' or some other actuator to stop balls getting stuck. These balls continue running downwards with gravity to a unit which detects the colour of the next ball and pushes the ball diagonally upwards in one of two directions - up and left for white, up and right for black. This gives us two queues of white and black balls. The length of these queues are important - they need to be long enough that there is no chance of one queue filling up while the other one is empty. At the end of both queues is another actuator which will push from either queue into the output queue to create the required pattern. The pattern then needs to be lifted into the output column, perhaps using a bucket lift. Actuators Ideally, we want something strong (as we may be pushing a lot of ping pong balls) and quiet. Electric solenoids may not be strong enough. Pneumatic would be but have the problem of having a compressor running all the time. The compressor could be run quite some way away with a reservoir on the display. Pneumatic power has the advantage that we can easily use it to create a lift by pushing balls along pipes. We could also use electric gearmotors with cranks, which will be slower, but smoother. Wiper motors with auto-park would be ideal. Potential problems Because of the wall thickness, a stack of plastic tubes large enough to fit ping pong balls into will be taller than a stack of ping pong balls - and so the rows won't match up. Crush strength of ping pong balls. We need to know how much force we can apply before one will dent - this may limit the length of the display. Alternative designs - the 'connect 4 clock' The first idea for this design was an automated connect 4 board, which fed in different coloured balls or counters from the top of the system and emptied out rows one at a time to the bottom. A 'write head' would move left to right across the top of the machine, dropping white or black balls into vertical tubes. You could easily turn this into a clock by emptying out one digit's worth of columns at a time.

Status The Roland CNC machine has a moving XYZ table, controlled by a smoothieboard. The existing spindle housing has been refitted with new bearings and an ER16 collet shank. The following work needs to be done to make this work: Reconnection of the motor control board in the front panel and optical speed sensor to the motor control board in the back panel Construction of a new 400mm drive belt (see the pulley section below) A 12V power supply needs to be added to supply the front panel. This doesn't need to supply any significant current; it's just to power the speed sensor, so a linear regulator will probably do the job. The new ER16 shank is slightly shorter than the previous shank. This means the flats on the collet chuck are recessed into the spindle housing, making it difficult to tighten the collet. It may be necessary to make a specialised spanner to tighten and loosen the chuck. Links CAMM-3 Yahoo Group PNC-3000 User Manual (too big to upload) Bob's git repository related to the smoothie board Spindle motor The motor is an AC motor which we have a drive system for. There are two wires connecting the motor to the motor PCB. The motor PCB is the one which has an IEC C14 mains socket (kettle lead socket). The speed sensor feeds a series of pulses into J102 on the front panel. Inside the front panel is a frequency to voltage converter, which outputs a voltage between 0 and 12V, representing the speed of the spindle. This voltage is called FV and feeds into the motor PCB on the back of the machine. There is an EA6302A chip which does this conversion. Bob identifies this as a BA6302A: BA6302A Datasheet . FV feeds into the front panel as well to display the speed. The datasheet mentions a 'mid-bias voltage' of 4.6V. The FV voltage feeds an op-amp whose other side is set using the potentiometer on the motor control board. The op-amp will then output a 'faster' or 'slower' digital signal. Because of this arrangement, it won't be possible to control the speed of the motor unless we have a speed sensor, unless we completely replace the motor driver circuit. Connecting to the SmoothieBoard SmoothieBoard's spindle module contains support for PID loopback spindle control . This takes a pulse chain from an encoder (which we have!) and uses it as the input componante of a PID loop, generating a PWM output. Using a simple resistor & capacitor, we can smooth this PWM into an analog signal suitable for feeding into the spindle speed controller. Axis stepper motors These are 6 wire, 2 phase, 1.5A motors. Rated 5.4V, driven at roughly 33V with a 0.9 degree step. The axis stepper motors all have six wire connectors. All of the original connectors were arranged in a different order, but for each motor, the red and blue wires are one coil, and the green and black wires are the second coil. White and yellow are centre taps for each coil. We won't need the centre taps. All three motors originally attach to the main board and are driven by SI-7300A chips. The driver chips are fed with 33V, via a zener diode and transistor from the 35V supply. Limit switches There only appear to be limit switches for one end of each axis. Power We need: 24V for the Smoothieboard VBB 12V to feed the Motor PCB 5V to feed the spindle speed sensor, and optionally the 5V on the Smoothieboard, although it can generate its own The power supply taken from the old laser cutter can produce 24V, which might be useful. On this power supply, mains (either way round) goes in on the right, and 24V and 5V come out on the left. The top-left connector was not in use on the laser. The input to the Motor PCB is only expected to drive a couple of op amps, so could be generated from a linear regulator off 24V. Chuck Roland have a bizarre proprietary chuck which screws into the spindle with a 9x1 fine pitch metric thread. This has been discarded and the existing housing has been refitted with new bearings and a more standard ER16 collet shank. There is a mechanical drawing of the spindle holder on github: https://github.com/jmacarthur/camm3-spindle Pulleys Here is a diagram of the pulleys on the top of the machine. This needs a 400mm long pulley which can fit into the 5mm wide v-section pulleys. Since v-belt in this size is difficult to find, we recommend using 5mm round belt instead. 5mm polyurethane belt can be found on eBay, for example: http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/301494667571 . This can be cut to the size required and welded by heating both ends with a lighter. The join this makes is much stronger than you might expect.

Hardware The physical device consists of four solenoids (salvaged from HP laser printers) with 'drumsticks' which actually hit the instruments. These are driven from a 24V transformer (salvaged from a Canon printer), and controlled through a transistor interface by an Arduino with an Ethernet shield. The instruments consist of a cowbell, two bongos, and a larger drum. The actual drum part has been working for some time now, although I've refined it recently. Software Currently, the Arduino sketch holds the rhythm patterns as a string of 16 hexadecimal nybbles, each representing one semiquaver, with each instrument as one bit. There are multiple patterns, and every bar each instrument chooses a random pattern, giving a huge range of combinations. The drummer works in one of two ways: Originally it read an online PHP script which accessed Twitter and did most of the processing. Then version 2 did all the processing on the Arduino, so it connects direct to Twitter. For version 3, I'm thinking of going back to reading an external script, so I can incorporate lots of advanced features. Arduino sketch to follow - soon! Present Status The device works fine. It's been shown at Playspace in Manchester, and Maker Faire UK 2011 in Newcastle. Like I mentioned, I'm going back to reading a PHP script so I can do such things as allowing people to make up their own rhythms and so on.

Then I modified it to use water rather than light. The user moves their hand around in a container of water, which electronically generates the sound of tinkling chimes. Hardware This started as something to test a MIDI shield I'd made. Basically, it has a potential divider made of two LDRs, which is connected to an analog-in pin. As you wave your hand over the LDRs it outputs rising and falling MIDI note data. Since I decided to make this a proper project, I've added two buttons to set the sensitivity limits of the two LDRs (in software). Also, I've had this plugged into my (musical) keyboard, but the intention is to get a small MIDI sound-module. I've had a look on eBay, and they actually go for more than I expected. Due to my obsession with my projects costing as little as humanly possible, I've decided that a better solution might be to get an old keyboard (with MIDI) and use the innards from that, removing the bits I don't need. The actual PCBs inside these things are remarkably small, and they have built in amps and speakers. I've now bought a couple of keyboards off eBay for 99p each (the sellers were not happy there *snigger*). I just have to take one apart and see how it's connected up (for power button, etc.). I can live with doing everything (like changing voices) in software, but you still need to press the power button to turn it on. UPDATE! I've now changed this project to work off water rather than light. There is a container of water with 5V across it. The user puts their hand in the water and completes a circuit by touching a conductor on the edge of the container with their other hand. The sensitivity buttons were removed because the voltage across the water is constant - unlike when I was using LDRs. Software The software reads the input voltage and maps the value onto the note-range of the MIDI sound device. Also, to make it more like proper chimes, the notes are echoed, and have randomness built into their decay volumes and timings. Present Status UPDATE! This was changed to work off water rather than light, and has been finished to a point where it can be exhibited, which it was at FutureEverything 2011 It works, but the electronics are a bit of a mess to look at. They are currently hidden. I've decided that this is going to be my first project to take the Atmega chip out of the Arduino and into it's own custom board. FURTHER UPDATE! This project has now been disassembled! I've decided to take the inner workings and do something else with them. The water chimes were cool, but there were too many things about them which frustrated me, so I'll be modifying the remains into something new.

This project has now been disassembled! I've decided to take the inner workings and do something else with them. The water chimes were cool, but there were too many things about them which frustrated me, so I'll be modifying the remains into something new.

This is our third location, into which we moved in April 2016. It's always evolving - we currently have separate rooms for woody/dusty work and for metalwork; as well as a social area, electronics area, craft corner, and chillax zone. Wellington House is open 24/7 for all members! Access Access to Wellington House is controlled by A.L.FR.E.D . You'll need an RFID tag / fob / card to get in - if you haven't got one (e.g. a bus ticket smartcard or building access prox card) you can buy a keyring token from us for \u00a32. To set a tag up, you'll need to come when someone else is there to let you in - open evenings are a good bet. Getting Here Tram The nearest tram stop is Holt Town, from which Hacman is a 300m uphill walk. Walk from the platform towards the traffic lights, and turn right at the derelict pub (\"The Mitchell Arms\") onto Beswick Street . Carry on walking past some small shops and turn right into Pollard Street East after the end of the palisade fencing. The entrance to Hacman is a blue door on your left. Train Piccadilly station is about a mile away. There are trams from Piccadilly and Victoria stations to Holt Town. Bus All buses from Piccadilly Gardens (stop D), other than fabled buses on mythical route 82, stop near Hacman. Buses on routes 216, 231, and 237 stop beside Holt Town tram stop. Buses on routes 74, 76, 76A, and 217 stop on Bradford Road, from which Hacman is a 350m downhill walk. From the bus stop walk to the traffic lights, turn left onto Beswick Street , and take the first left onto Pollard Street East . The entrance to Hacman is a blue door on your left. Car There is very limited parking on site. Parking on street is plentiful, but is limited to permit holders only on days when there is an event at the Etihad. Be aware that if Manchester City are playing at home, traffic will be worse and parking will be less available. Beswick Street is often closed at the Ashton New Road end during football matches.

If you are on OSX, you may need to download the Platform Independant ZIP instead of the OSX Release. If you are a software developer with experience of OSX packaging, Visicut are looking for help with this issue ! On first run, Visicut will ask if you want to download settings. You do, just select Manchester, UK: Hackspace from the list and Visicut will automatically install the latest settings for our laser cutter. You can use this same method to reset your settings back to the default, under the menu item Options > Settings > Download Recommended Settings . You may get an error message, error importing settings . If this occurs, just close and reopen Visicut for the settings to apply. Inkscape For vector editing and manipulation, we suggest people use Inkscape. It is a free and powerful vector editing package, and integrates well with Visicut. It can be downloaded here . Once you have Visicut and Inkscape installed, and have run Inkscape at least once (so it creates its folders in your home drive), You can install the Inkscape addon for Visicut by clicking Extras > Install Inkscape Extension in Visicut. Close and reopen Inkscape and you should have new options for sending vectors directly to Visicut. Cutting Before lasering / cutting the main thing to be aware of is overheating The laser cutter has a inbuilt water pump / cooler which needs to be running There's also an extraction pipe for getting rid of the fumes Warnings WARNING The water pump must be running before cutting Otherwise you may cause damage to the Laser Cutter This can be verified by checking the red light is on in the water cooling chamber After Cutting make sure to leave the plugged in and turned on for at least 5 mins to allow the water pump to cool. Otherwise you may cause damage to the Laser Cutter Informational Make sure to watch over the cutter as it's cutting. Rule 0 - don't be on fire Failure In the event something goes wrong Mail the mailing list with a short description of the problem What you were trying to do What you expected to happen What happened instead Put the out of order sign on the top of the cutter Let the cutter cool down for 5 mins before turning off In the event of fire / emergency There is an emergency stop button on the top panel that is functional. Opening the lid will stop the laser from firing however. If you can smother the fire in-place using a piece of stock, do so. If you cant smother it in place, put it on the floor and try to stomp it out. If you cant do either of these. Leave the space immediately, and call 999.

Time log is in the front of the book, Money log is in the back Turn on the chiller, this can be found to the left of the laser cutter on the floor Positioning the part With the orange laser the only thing to worry about is the Z axis. There is a switch on the right hand side of the machine that can be used to lower or raise the main bed of the machine. It's a bit slow, but make sure not to crash the bed into the laser head, since there isn't a limit switch installed There is a small wooden guide inside the machine that can be used to position / zero the height against the bed (the default position). This goes in between the bed and the left-hand part of the laser cutter, as in the following photo: File:Photo562824656796624810.jpg|Laser Focus Guide For cutting materials up to 6mm it's best to have the z height set to bed level. For cutting materials over 6mm, try to keep the z height 6mm into the material. Multiple passes may be needed. For engraving set the focal point to the height of the material by placing the guide on top of it. If you want crisp engraving on thick stock, you will need to do a 2-stage engrave / cut with the focal point initially set to the top of your material, and then re-set to the correct height for your cut.

Tas 2014-12-12 Built new cable to test stepper directly from driver. Still had issue. Switched around drivers, still had issue. Tested motor separately with no belt, X axis motor is fucked. Replaced Motor, restored original stepper driver + config, halfed steps/m because new motor goes twice as far per step. Rebuilt and did basic realign. Still needs full realign. Wept. Bob 2014-01-31 Replaced tube, rebuilt and cleaned X-Y axes, added new mechanical endstop to Y axis to replace shitty opto flag. Replaced feet with rubber feet. Bob 2015-02-21 Tightened X axis belt to reduce wobble. Bob 2015-02-21 Unkinked coolant tube - laser is now at full power. Bob 2015-03-04 Replaced mirror that had EXPLODED! Bob 2015-03-11 Replaced grub screw that had fallen out of carriage. Chris 2015-03-14 Changed microstepping on X and steps/mm value to be the same as Y - makes motion far smoother.

To arrange an induction give us a shout on the Laser Training Telegram Group or on the forum . If you don't get a response just give us another poke, we may have missed it. The induction includes setting up your computer to use the laser, instruction on how to use the software, and using the laser in a way that is safe to you and the machine itself. Members should feel free to re-take the induction at any time, and if you don't feel you can safely use the laser cutter then you are encouraged to sign up for a reminder class before using it. Things you need: \u00a32 to cover the cost of the induction Things that are good to have: A prepared design to cut, in .svg format, there is an example below (this should have a bit to cut, a bit to mark, and a bit to engrave; we will be using fill colours to designate what/where to cut, so strokes will be ignored) A laptop with Inkscape/Visicut installed (don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t have one, you can use a computer in the space) Helpful wiki pages: http://wiki.hacman.org.uk/Laser_Cutter/OrangeLaser http://wiki.hacman.org.uk/Laser_Cutter/Materials If you have any questions before the induction please do ask, likewise if you want any advice/help with your design. We like to keep the designs cut during training quite small, preferably about 5cm by 5cm, so bear that in mind whilst designing anything! There\u2019s no need to bring any material to cut, but you are more than welcome to. We have plenty of scrap acrylic/ply/mdf and can offer an A6 piece of ply for the first cut.

They all have either screwed up gearboxes, broken batteries, or such a huge self discharge that the batteries are always completely flat. The chargers for them are also ancient, so they use a lot of electricity when not charging. I'd like to look at buying a couple of nice, new, lithium battery powered electric screwdrivers. At home I have a set of Ryobi One+ tools, which are great. They last forever, have good torque right to the end of the battery, and aren't too expensive for the power. I used them last year to build all the grey tables in the current space, and they're still going strong now. The batteries are compatible across the whole range of tools, so we could get an Impact Screwdriver , Nail Gun or Chainsaw Lance at a later date and use the same batteries. This pledge is to buy 2 of these packs from B&Q, giving us: 2x Hammer Drill / Screwdriver Bodies 4x Lithium One+ batteries 2x One+ Chargers And allowing us to dispose of all the rubbish existing screwdrivers.

It's time to replace it with a newer model. Since we\u2019re updating, we might as well get something bigger and better! I\u2019ve been looking into various options, and the best one for us seems to be a Chinese 6040 Laser Cutter, like the following: This laser has the following good stuff: A 600mm x 400mm bed size (4 times the area of our current laser). A 50W tube, allowing us to cut thicker material, up to around 12mm deep. Air assist, red dot pointer and a HoneyComb Bed. A height-adjustable bed, to allow engraving on super thick materials (up to 250mm deep). A rotary axis for engraving on bottles and other round stuff! I\u2019ve recently been over to Leeds Hackspace, who have bought the 60W version of this laser cutter for their hackspace and wanted it upgraded with a LAOS board. The cutter seemed very well made, and came with all the bells and whistles I had to add myself to the old laser. Conversion to LAOS took around 5 hours total, and was up and running right away. The total for buying the laser cutter, and replacing the electronics with the LAOS board we currently use is \u00a31600. Whatever you give will be matched with laser time on the new cutter - If you give \u00a3100 you\u2019ll get \u00a3100 of credit automatically! I\u2019m going to start the pledging off at \u00a3200 because i\u2019m pretty cool like that. Goals \u00a31600 - 50W 6040 Laser Cutter \u00a31900 - we can afford to up the anti and get the 60W version!

With smaller components, it can get more difficult to see exactly what you're soldering, and in turn, far harder to solder up projects. Industrially this is solved with a solid binocular microscope. The binocular bit is important as it gives depth of field to your vision while working in its view, allowing you to naturally gauge how far your tools are from your workpiece. Recently the Strange Parts youtube channel did a video on his microscope, and has managed to get the seller to start selling them on Aliexpress .

These things weigh over 100kg, and are designed for folding metal sheets to specific angles.

We believe it's a straight folder like the one on that page, and if we can get it 'free', or really, for the cost of delivery, that would be a huge saving on a new one.
